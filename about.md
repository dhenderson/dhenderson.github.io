Hey there, my name is David Henderson and I have worked with a wide range of organizations in the social sector helping them get more from their operational, outcomes, and donor data. I work at the [Family Independence Initiative][fii] where I’m the Chief Data Officer.

I am generally interested in income inequality, homelessness, extreme poverty, and how data and technology can be used to make the world a better place.

I have a Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management with Highest Distinction from Carnegie Mellon University.
