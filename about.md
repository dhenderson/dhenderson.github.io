Hey there, my name is David Henderson and I have worked with a wide range of organizations in the social sector helping them get more from their operational, outcomes, and donor data. I work at the [Family Independence Initiative][fii] where Iâ€™m the Chief Data Officer.

My professional focus is on improving the way social sector organizations utilize information to implement higher impact interventions. I have been quoted in the Chronicle of Philanthropy and have written for Change.org and the Huffington Post.

I have a Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management with Highest Distinction from Carnegie Mellon University.
