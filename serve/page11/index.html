      <article class="post-content">
        <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs and the White House are holding an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/06/05/reaching-out-fight-veteran-homelessness">app competition</a> for mobile applications that connect unhoused persons to social programs. The competition has announced the top five finalists, including the demeaningly named <a href="http://sherlockhomeless.org/">Sherlock Homeless</a>, but triviality has already stolen the show.</p>
<p>The premise of the app competition was flawed from the outset, and is emblematic of a chronic syndrome in the social sector. We are too easily swayed by the trends of the corporate world, time and again believing that if we just copy what those in the corporate sector do we will enjoy success.</p>
<p>In the mid to late 2000s the craze was hiring MBAs into the social sector. If only non-profits were more like businesses! The economic collapse at the hands of MBAs cooled that trend, but alas the app craze filled our empty panacea cup.</p>
<p>As Silicon Valley blazes trails like it did in the 1990s, the social sector has started wondering why there is an app for sharing photos with friends, but there is no app for ending poverty. Well, photo sharing is trivial, ending poverty is not.</p>
<p>But, we can make trivial applications <em>about</em> poverty. That must count for something right?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And yet the White House itself is pushing the misnomer that technology can solve social problems. It cannot. If connecting people to homeless services was simple enough that a part-time developer could solve this problem, Google would have done so a long time ago. Google indexes pretty much every website on the Internet, so why does Google search fail to effectively connect people to services?</p>
<p>Social service agencies do not always have a web-presence, and when they do, they do not adequately maintain their sites with sufficient information to make referrals. That is why <a href="http://www.211.org/">211</a>, and my own company, employ people to manually maintain our resource databases. The problem of maintaining resource data is not a technological one, it is logistical, and there is no app for that.</p>
<p>I am not arguing that there is no place for technology in the social sector. As a firm that uses technology in its work with social sector organizations, obviously I believe there is a place for technical innovation in our work. But slick, shiny apps with ridiculous names and soon to be outdated databases are not what anyone needs.</p>
<p>There is a reason that in the app economy apps sells for a dollar. They are easy to make, and easy to forget. We don’t need apps, we need real solutions.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-826" title="Low standards" src="/assets/images/low-standards_design-250x250.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" />Measurements are often given meaning relative to thresholds. Someone is housed or unhoused, poor or not poor, by some definition. Yet these thresholds are arbitrary, and open to debate and manipulation. While one might think there would be agreement on what <a href="http://www.povertyinsights.org/2012/04/05/battle-reopens-over-definition-of-homelessness/">homeless</a> means, especially since it is a word that almost defines itself, there is considerable argument over its definition with significant policy consequences.</p>
<p>As the social sector struggles to measure its impact and make the case that real progress is being made, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lausd-college-20120418,0,1437173.story">LA Unified School District (LAUSD) might have found the easiest and most fool proof way of increasing graduation rates</a>; lower graduation standards. The LAUSD is facing a dropout crisis, and like many social sector organizations, whether government or non-profit, is feeling the pressure to improve outcomes based on a set of measurable indicators. For schools, a fairly important indicator is graduating students.</p>
<p>Yet graduation is actually a proxy for <em>being educated</em>. While econometric models tend to find positive returns to education (more education more money) the diploma itself does not beget a wage increase. Instead, diplomas are a signal that a worker can perform at a certain level. Although lowering graduation requirements, in this case by potentially allowing students to graduate with fewer credits and lower grade point averages, will increase graduation rates, will it actually make students more educated? And what about those students who graduate under current LAUSD standards, might this proposal cause them harm by allowing students to take fewer classes or earn worse grades?</p>
<p>I'm no education expert, but I work with a range of organizations facing considerable pressure to move the needle on one metric or another. But this approach the LAUSD is considering could set a dangerous precedent for the social sector. If an employment agency wants to inflate employment statistics, it might conflate temp work with full time jobs. And if a homeless services organization wanted to show an improvement in housing placements, it might refuse to work with chronically homeless persons and only serve those whose homeless-spell would last a month regardless of interventions.</p>
<p>Is someone who is 101% of the poverty line not poor while someone who is 99% of the poverty line poor? Any anti-poverty organization worth its salt would want to help both of these people, regardless of an arbitrary line set by the federal government. We use thresholds to help describe what we <em>mean</em> by the objectives we aim to address. Lowering our standards and adjusting how we define measurement of our objectives is an easy way to inflate our outcomes, but it is not terribly satisfying and is in no way meaningful.</p>
<p>The LAUSD would be wise to focus its efforts on helping students achieve its vision of an educated youth population rather than lowering its standards to award diluted diplomas. The people we serve are more than binary variables that fail or succeed. Our outcomes metrics are only valuable if they help identifying where we truly succeed and fail. If instead we simply want high scores, then make up any number you want and call it a day.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-821" title="Righ and wrong decisions" src="/assets/images/unnamed-250x202.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="202" />Evaluating organizational effectiveness is a growing sub-field of the social sector, with a slew of competing measurement frameworks. Something a lot of these frameworks assess is whether organizations make use of data management system. The idea is that an organization that has a data management system in place is more likely to be data savvy and to actively manage to outcomes.</p>
<p>This might be a reasonable proxy for whether an organization actually incorporates evidence in its practice. But from where I stand, data only has value in so far as it helps an organization make higher impact decisions. Therefore, I propose a more robust approach to evaluating an organizations use of metrics.</p>
<p>If an organization's behavior before implementing a data oriented approach is exactly the same after implementation, then no value has been added. Data should help inform <em>action</em>, not just confirm prior beliefs. It's hard to imagine any organization (or individual) that does everything so perfectly that there is no room for improvement.</p>
<p>Effective uses of data collection and evaluative analysis should help drive program improvements. If you can't identify any changes in your organization's behavior, then whether or not the organization has a data management system and processes in place to collect information, it has not actually benefited from its data efforts.</p>
<p>More important, just because an organization changes its behavior based on metrics does not necessarily mean it benefited from an effective use of information. Indeed, information should help us make <em>better</em> decisions. In some cases, organizations make poor decisions that are backed by data.</p>
<p>A classic example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Space Shuttle Columbia disaster</a>. NASA used information to back up its decision to go ahead with a shuttle launch in suboptimal weather, that lead to the disintegration of the shuttle's O-ring and a subsequent explosion that killed all the astronauts on board.</p>
<p>In this case, NASA made a data-backed decision, but it used its data incorrectly and made the wrong inference, resulting in disastrous consequences. Therefore, it's not only important to collect your data and use it, but to take care to analyze your data properly, and listen to reason of all parties.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my most important indicator of whether an organization uses information well. Information should <em>inform</em> decision making, but it should not necessarily, on its own, <em>dictate</em> what an organization does. While having a data management system in place is great, and using reasoned analysis in the interpretation of data is better, there is no replacing the judgment of experienced practitioners and the feedback of those we serve.</p>
<p>The best organizations include evaluate metrics as a part of their decision frameworks, but they do not supplant their own judgment for a regression.</p>

In principle, this is a good thing. Information should help inform decision making. But there is a big difference between information informing your agenda and allowing it to set it.</p>
<p>Data should inform your answers to questions, but data sets should never determine what questions you seek to answer. Every organization grapples with a myriad of decision problems, from optimizing resource allocations to increasing the social impact of interventions.</p>
<p>The natural role of information is to help us make more informed decisions. But data does not, on its own, answer any questions. And no data set can (or should) determine the most important issues facing an organization. Those questions should be driven by the organization itself and the people it serves.</p>
<p>Yet time and again I see organizations blankly asserting that they need data. Why?</p>
<p>A lot of organizations don't have a great answer beyond citing the overall direction of our industry. This is a pretty lousy answer, and more importantly leads to half-baked data collection implementations that do nothing to drive organizational change or improve outcomes.</p>
<p>Each organization I work with, before talking about data management systems, what data points to collect, or internal processes for collecting metrics, I ask them what they do and what problems they face. Simply put, you don't know what data you need until you know what problems you're trying to address.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the glorification of trivial info-graphics and blanket mandate that organizations should be "data driven" perpetuates a wrong-headed belief that there is inherent value in data. As someone whose whole lively-hood is based in data collection and analysis, let me be as clear as I can, data only has value when it informs a decision.</p>
<p>As a sector, we'd be wise to focus less on the "data, data, data" mantra, and to instead engage in discussions about the issues organizations face, and where metrics can help inform better decision making. Despite the misleading glee of those who proclaim the data revolution will transform the social sector, data itself is nothing but a distraction unless it answers specific questions an organization faces.</p>

As 2011 draws to a close, I reflect on another year helping a lot of great organizations increase their social impact, and a pile of blog posts that I <em>hope</em> help advance the social sector toward lasting change.</p>
<p>Obviously I believe writing, and the exchange of ideas that comes with it, is important to the growth of our sector and advancement of solutions. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't write anything. But as someone who prefers evidence to anecdotes, facts to feelings, I'm at a loss for much evidence that blogging (at least my blogging) helps move the needle even a little bit.</p>
<p>I feel like I get quite a bit more than I give in terms of writing. And maybe that is okay, so long as I believe writing helps me get better at what I do, and that what I do with my agency has social value.</p>
<p>But my ambition for writing and the promise of free-flows of information in the social sector exceed simply personal gratification and advancement. My hope is that by sharing with one another what works and what doesn't, that we would improve our own services, turning those little insights into collective action.</p>
<p>While articles about changes in the poverty rate and <a href="http://www.povertyinsights.org/2011/06/17/la-homeless-count-finds-homelessness-either-increasing-or-decreasing/">misleading homeless counts</a> are compelling reads for people like us, if that information exchange doesn't improve the output of our efforts, then what are we doing? There are certainly times when I worry that the articles we write and share with one another have no value other than to amuse ourselves, like a gossip rag for poverty-geeks.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong, and in 2012 I plan to actively seek evidence to the contrary. I want to believe that we are evolving into a sector that thrives on sharing best practices and possesses the sophistication to integrate information across the fields of politics, sociology, finance, social work, community development, and a slew of other focus areas that collectively sum to the vastness of the social sector.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is in the vastness of the social sector that I worry the value of our information exchange is lost. As you know, the social sector is complex. Its complexity in part stems from the fact that it is not so much <em>a sector</em>, but rather a <em>sector of sectors</em> (some call it the <a href="http://www.unsectored.net/">un-sector</a>). The sector-of-sectors nature I fear lends itself to sharing information in parallel, rather than exchanging information that directly impacts what we do.</p>
<p>I, like you, picked this line of work to improve the lives of hurting people. When we read posts, share information, and write on our blogs, we are diverting our time away from our work. I hope, I <em>think</em>, this is a good use of our time. I think writing matters, and I hope in 2012 I can prove it to myself.</p>
