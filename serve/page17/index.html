        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/articulatematter/4257546283/in/photostream/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-160" src="/assets/images/Micro-Problem-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" /></a>What ever happened to thinking big? In the social sector, thinking small, micro to be exact, is all the rage, and perhaps with some reason. The blunt force of macro interventions like clumsy development aid have drawn the intense scrutiny of people like <a title="Bill Easterly" href="http://www.aidwatchers.com/">Bill Easterly</a>.</p>
<p>Failing the success of sweeping interventions, the sector has recently become obsessed with micro solutions to social problems. The wave of micro activity started with the popularity of microcredit, but has recently devolved into a flurry of any philanthropic word pre-fixed with "micro" such as <a title="micro-volunteering" href="../../../../../2009/11/why-im-not-extraordinary/">micro-volunteering</a>, micro-donations, micro-philanthropy, and micro-actions.</p>
<p>My macro point here is that the momentary micro dogma of the social sector distracts us from pursuing real solutions that help people.  What matters, of course, is what works, small, medium, large, or super-sized.  The micro-trend was started by microcredit, the first, and only member of the "micro" solution set that resembles a real intervention rather than a gimmick focused more on size than effectiveness.</p>
<p>Microcredit is micro in so far as it is a small loan to an impoverished person, ostensibly used for wealth creating activities. While microcredit has been heralded in some circles as a powerful poverty-reduction tool, recent evaluative research has raised some important questions. Specifically, David Roodman speculates there might be a microcredit bubble in Bangladesh. Roodman <a title="writes" href="http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2010/02/grameen-bank-which-pioneered-loans-for-the-poor-has-hit-a-repayment-snag.php">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, multiple borrowing is widespread in Bangladesh now, and it has raised concerns that some Bangladeshis are juggling microcredit loans the way some Americans juggle credit card debt, in a merry-go-round that must one day stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>As borrowers acquire multiple loans their debts becoming increasing less micro, raising doubts about microcredit's core promise that the poor need only small loans to lift themselves out of poverty, a falsehood promoted more by <a title="Kiva" href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva's</a> marketing than the fundamental tenants of the microcredit movement.</p>
<p>While the idea that a modest investment by Western standards can create sustainable businesses is appealing, evidence of multiple borrowing undermines this hope. Even though most people involved in the day-to-day development of microcredit as a poverty intervention strategy take a sophisticated, nuanced approach to microcredit, its widespread popularity has less to do with actual outcomes and more to do with the suggestion that solving big problems only requires small actions.</p>
<p>And here, I believe, is where the micro thinking begins to unravel.</p>
<p>The current adherence to the micro dogma does not come from a measured understanding of effectiveness of micro approaches. Instead, our fascination with all things micro stems from a hope that simple, small, and intuitive sounding actions can solve tremendously complicated problems. By attempting to reduce the daunting magnitude of poverty to something we can solve through trivial investments, shopping, and meaningless minute-at-a-time volunteer activities, we simply aggregate our micro inabilities to solve social problems into a macro inability to solve social problems.</p>
<p>Over on the Tactical Philanthropy Blog comments section reader Chip McComb <a title="sums up" href="http://tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/03/the-guilt-of-the-social-investor/comment-page-1#comment-8633">sums up</a> the problem with micro giving nicely, in so doing revealing much of what is wrong with micro thinking in general. Chip writes</p>
<blockquote><p>I fear that as micro giving, and mobile giving becomes more and more prevalent the attitude of those that give, could shift dangerously to think that all giving should be as easy and as pleasing as buying a coke or a big mac, and when it’s not easy or pleasing, it is therefore not worth their time or expense. What a dangerous trap!</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not arguing that all micro efforts are problematic. There are some great virtues of thinking small, so long as micro means local approaches to social problems, small strategic investments (like microcredit), or other such reasoned uses that resemble actual strategies. My problem with the current wave of micro thinking is that micro has become a euphemism for easy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is providing solutions that work. In some cases, small interventions might work best, like microcredit, in other cases, perhaps our investments need to be large and <a title="patient" href="http://www.acumenfund.org/about-us/what-is-patient-capital.html">patient</a>, rather than micro, like Acumen Fund's approach to social investing. Whatever the size of the intervention, all our approaches should be well reasoned and rigorously evaluated.</p>
<p>Of course, unlike our modern micro interventions, evaluation is hard, even if it is indispensable in expanding what works and purging what does not.  Recognizing both the importance and complexity of evaluation, perhaps I should pursue the idea of micro-evaluation, a simple evaluative framework that is as easy to use as it is meaningless.</p>

<p>Those of us who work on poverty alleviation no doubt get into this field out of a commitment to reduce poverty.  As we join organizations we believe in or develop poverty interventions of our own however, our loyalties shift in subtle ways.  Where once the poor themselves were paramount in our ambitions, our ambitions instead become about the success of <em>our</em> solutions.  If our solutions do not reduce poverty, we are perversely incentivized to argue with the evidence before us, rather than admit what we are doing is not working.</p>
<p>In this way, our sector as a whole is not trying to end poverty per se.  Instead, we are trying to be the <em>one's</em> to end poverty.  If we blind ourselves by ambition and moral outrage, we render ourselves incapable of allowing outcomes metrics and social indicators to guide our poverty interventions.  If we fail to use data, we will fail to end poverty.</p>

Designing good surveys and collecting client data is hard. Rating how we feel about a particular program on a scale from one to five is easy.  As a sector, we need to guide funding towards programs that work, and abandon ones that don't. If we are to reliably move resources towards the highest achieving organizations, we have to define what high achieving means.</p>
<p>To me, the answer to what makes an organization high achieving is clear.  The social service sector exists to reduce social ills like poverty, homelessness, and food insecurity.  Organizations that have a greater impact on improving the lives of their clients are better than those that have less.  Any evaluative framework that is not centered on measuring changes in client indicators is irrelevant. Despite this obvious point, I am dismayed by how celebrated efforts like the <a href="http://inforumusa.org/Blogs/911050080/Effective-Social-Investing">Alliance for Social Investing</a> and <a href="http://inforumusa.org/Blogs/911201392/A-%22Yelp%22-for-Nonprofits:-How-Getting-Reviews-Can-Help-the-Homeless">Greatnonprofits.org</a> fail to base their evaluative criterion on client outcomes.</p>
<p>There is a lot at stake in getting a rating system right (or wrong).  The potential harm a poor rating system can cause was illustrated last week in a partnership between Greatnonprofits.org and Guidestar.org.  These two rating organizations teamed up to compile a list of the "Top Ten Relief Organizations Working In Haiti."  The list was compiled based on a handful of donor reviews, and as non-profit consultant<strong> </strong>Gayle Gifford <a href="http://www.ceffect.com/blog/effectiveness/my-worst-nightmare-is-now-true-sloppy-ratings-of-nonprofit-effectiveness/">pointed out</a>, those organizations "that were listed in the Top 10, had ONLY 1 or 2 Reviews. That's it."</p>
<p>Greatnonprofits.org and Guidestar.org responded to Ms. Gifford's criticism by <a href="http://www.ceffect.com/blog/effectiveness/thank-you-guidestar-for-hearing-our-concerns/">dropping the top ten list</a> all together.  While these rating organizations certainly did the right thing by retracting their list, it is amazing to me that two supposed evaluation leaders in our industry could have compiled such a hasty, pointless agency ranking in the first place. There is so much that is problematic here, least of all the paltry number of reviews the top ten list was based on.</p>
<p>If we are to ever develop a meaningful top ten list of the most effective social programs, we have to embrace the social scientific complexities of evaluating clients' social outcomes.  This means taking the collection and analysis of client data, in its quantitative and qualitative forms, seriously. Simplistic rating systems that ask donors how they feel about a particular organization may seem seductive, but they could not be more beside the point in determining which organizations are best able to improve the lives of hurting people.  So long as we fail to move towards an evaluative framework that is centered on sound social outcomes practices, the only top ten list we can reliably compile is the "Top Ten Worst Ways to Rank Non-Profits."</p>

<blockquote><p>About six million Americans receiving food stamps report they have no other income, according to an analysis of state data collected by The New York Times.

<p>The growing number of people receiving SNAP, but living without any cash income exposes a troubling hole in our social safety net.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families">TANF</a>, the primary cash aid welfare program design to aid poor families, has strict asset requirements and is only meant for families with dependent children.  The newly poor victims of the recession are people who are too asset rich to receive cash aid welfare, and therefore are subsisting only on food stamps.</p>

<p>The book is a quick, entertaining read, although I was disappointed that Venkatesh, writing for a wider audience, provides little academic analysis. The most useful takeaway from Gang Leader is that the residents of the housing project documented in the study view the gang as a part of the community, and not a solely negative one at that.  The gangs, while clear purveyors of drugs, act as a police presence for a community that has a poor relationship with the formal police force.  The gang also generates a lot of the community's economic activity and actively donates to political causes and celebrated social service organizations.</p>
<p>In no way does Venkatesh come across as a gang sympathizer.  Rather, he is a realist, arguing that gangs play several roles in the community.  While I would recommend Gang Leader to someone looking for a fairly light read, I'm currently reading another Venkatesh book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Off-Books-Underground-Economy-Urban/dp/0674030710/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261957916&amp;sr=8-2">Off the Books - the Underground Economy of the Poor</a> which thus far seems to be a better blend of compelling ethnography and substantive analysis.</p>
