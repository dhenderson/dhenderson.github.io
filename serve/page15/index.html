        <p><a href="/assets/images/fired.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-396" src="/assets/images/fired-250x233.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="233" /></a>Like any other industry, money drives the social sector. Sure it matters that our hearts are in the right places, and that we are willing to make less doing what we do. But we still work for a paycheck, and whether or not we can get a paycheck creating the social value we seek determines to some extent what we focus on.</p>
<p>The importance of money is the reason that the ongoing debate about how to rate charitable organizations matters. We do not simply want to know what works and what does not, but which agencies are deserving of charitable dollars. In short, what is at stake is not only which agencies get funded, but which causes do as well.</p>
<p>How we rate agencies will alter how agencies do business, which will in turn impact their bottom lines. That is why we have to be really careful with how we end up rating organizations. Charity Navigator <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/27/business/27charity.html?_r=4&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">realized</a> that their focus on administrative overhead not only mislead donors about which agencies were most impactful, but it also incented organizations to focus more on financial gymnastics than creating social value.</p>
<p>It’s great that Charity Navigator is making changes to the way it evaluates organizations and I’ll be following those changes closely. But if there has been so much widespread agreement that the focus on overhead ratios is a poor indicator, why has the sector abided by this fruitless metric for so long? Essentially, the Charity Navigator effect was to flood agencies with donors who contributed to those organizations for bad reasons.</p>
<p>I don’t run a non-profit. My company builds database systems and provides data analysis services for poverty-focused social sector organizations, so instead of donors I have customers. But the two really are not all that different. Just like donors, I have some agencies that hire my firm for good reasons, and others that hire us for stupid ones.</p>
<p>And just like non-profits, which have long accepted donations from individuals and foundations whose values do not align with their own, I too have been (and am) guilty of working with organizations whose missions are a poor fit with my company's values.</p>
<p>I have rationalized working with bad customers in the past by thinking I would use the money from those contracts to supplement the work my company really cares about. What I failed to acknowledge is that money not only enables you to follow your agenda, but it also has a way of setting it.</p>
<p>Basically, these bad customers led me and my team to focus on building features in our products that did not align with our core mission. We ended up spending staff time on issues that were at best tangentially related to the core poverty issues our company was built to address.</p>
<p>Non-profits do the same thing. It is a rare occasion when an agency turns down funds. I have seen my own customers accept grants for the sake of expansion, not thinking how that funding would impact the overall trajectory of the organization. A lot of funding comes with so many strings that it can pull an agency in multiple directions, resulting in devastating mission creep.</p>
<p>Rating social sector organizations well is vitally important. How we evaluate organizations determines which ones we fund, which in turn changes what agencies do. While I am all for better evaluation of non-profit organizations, perhaps the organizations would be wise to take the time to evaluate those who evaluate them in turn.</p>

        <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-386" href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/?attachment_id=386"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-386" src="/assets/images/eval-250x154.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="154" /></a>Our sector is enamored with the idea of reaching scale, no matter what the issue. We want to bring education reform to scale, poverty alleviation to scale, and now even evaluation to scale.</p>
<p>Lamenting the lack of funding available for social sector evaluations, Dan Pallotta writes in a post on<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2010/11/our-ineffectiveness-at-measuri.html"> Our Ineffectiveness at Measuring Effectiveness</a> that</p>
<blockquote><p>The watchdogs never achieved scale. The largest among them, Charity Navigator, evaluates about 8,000 of the active charities in the country, or 1.1%. And none of the new effectiveness organizations are on a trajectory to get much larger, even using relatively inexpensive and simple evaluation methods. For example, <a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>, one of the best of the bunch, measures only 413 organizations, or .059% of the active charities in the country. Why is this so? None has yet discovered a revenue model that can achieve dramatic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Dan is spot on to highlight the importance of evaluation in the social sector, his focus on scale is premature. The fact is that none of the evaluation methodologies<a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/01/great-non-profits-deserve-a-great-rating-system/"> available to us today</a> are worth scaling up.</p>
<p>Evaluation is complex, and Dan’s call for one evaluation agency to rule them all smacks of the oversimplification of those who<a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/11/abandoning-across-sector-evaluative-metrics/"> wrongly believe</a> evaluating non-profits is a specialty in itself. Part of the reason organizations like Charity Navigator have failed to evaluate organizations effectively is that they have tried to evaluate agencies that are too dissimilar from one another. Comparing the incomparable necessarily forces evaluators to rely on pointless metrics like<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2009/12/charity-navigator-fixes-its-compass.html"> overhead ratios</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps more damaging, the insistence on evaluating all types of agencies distracts from the more important work of developing sound methodologies in any one of the numerous philanthropic sub-sectors, such as environmental issues or poverty. Our ratings suck not just because of a lack of money, or imagination as Dan suggests, but a lack of focus and specialization.</p>
<p>An evaluation specialist is not necessarily someone who understands the managerial side of non-profits. Ideally, an evaluator would be an expert in the social or environmental issue a non-profit aims to influence.</p>
<p>If I want to evaluate an environmental organization, forget the non-profit consultant, give me an environmental expert. Yet the lauded evaluation agencies of today by-and-large fail to take an issue specific approach to outcomes evaluations.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work to do before bringing evaluations to scale. The first step is <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/11/abandoning-across-sector-evaluative-metrics/">abandoning the pointless pursuit</a> of an evaluation framework that compares all organizations, no matter what they do, with one another. If we can agree on that, we can begin the serious work of evaluating social and environmental outcomes. Eventually, we might even have something worthy of scale.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vagabondblogger/2915309623/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-372" src="/assets/images/goodbye-250x166.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166" /></a>The social sector is a complex industry to work in. While what we all do can be uniformly defined as philanthropically related, that is where the similarities for many of us ends. We are unified in so far as we want to do good in the world, but what that good is, and how we achieve it, varies wildly.</p>
<p>On Friday I wrote about the <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-limit-of-objectivity/">limit of objectivity</a>. There has been a groundswell toward basing social investments on objective realities rather than subjective emotions. Our sector has benefited tremendously from this new wave of thought.</p>
<p>One of the agencies pioneering the march toward greater accountability and evaluative objectivity is GiveWell. However, GiveWell’s recent move to drop their three star ranking illustrates the pitfalls of trying to force the appearance of objectivity on subjective issues. Describing GiveWell’s decision to drop the three-star ranking, Holden Karnofsky <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2010/09/27/why-charity-ratings-dont-work-as-of-now/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the end we don’t feel comfortable rating <a href="http://www.givewell.org/united-states/early-childhood/charities/NFP">Nurse-Family Partnership</a> higher than <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/Small-Enterprise-Foundation">Small Enterprise Foundation</a> … or lower … or the same. They’re too different; your decision on which to give to is going to come down to judgment calls and personal values.</p></blockquote>
<p>While there is an objective, fact-based reality of what an individual organization does or does not accomplish, how we value the change an agency creates in the world has more to do with personal values rather than an elusive universal truth of social value. GiveWell is right to recognize this fact and abandon the pointless pursuit of purported standardization of across sector evaluative metrics.</p>
<p>Indeed, the discussion about standardization of outcomes metrics in the social sector has been taken to unrealistic extremes. <a href="http://alleffective.org/">The Alliance for Effective Social Investing</a>, for example, allegedly aims to create a way of evaluating organizations that do unlike things, such as the comparison of an after-school program to a disaster relief agency.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>The standardization that we need is within focus areas, like a way of evaluating poverty focused organizations against one another. This is very difficult to do; a gang intervention program and low-income utility income supplement both target poverty, but they do so in different ways. Figuring out a way to compare these dissimilar programs with common social objectives is relevant and valuable in a way that comparing Green Peace to the ballet is not.</p>
<p>The rush to create true standardization has driven some to focus on organizational health metrics instead of social outcomes. If the goal is to equate unequatable organizations, then the focus on managerial indicators makes sense. It is the only logical way of comparing dissimilar agencies that do not have a shared social interest.</p>
<p>The problem is that organizational metrics do not say anything about outcomes. We don’t evaluate for-profit organizations on their managerial structures, we evaluate them based on profit. Their organizational abilities certainly impact the bottom line, but it is not in itself the bottom line.</p>
<p>There is no point in evaluating agencies based on proxy metrics like managerial indicators when we can, and should, simply measure their real outcomes: changes in social indicators. Those social indicators are comparable within focus areas, but not across them, which is fine.</p>
<p>The question we need to answer is not what philanthropists should focus on, instead we need a way of better identifying the highest impact agencies that address a funder’s focus area. Not only is this an important question, it is an answerable one.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to drop our quest to measure the unmeasurable. Instead, we should shift our focus to analyzing that which is empirical. Not only can we actually measure social impact within focus areas, it is also one of the <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/10/questions_that_matter/">only questions</a> worth answering.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left"><a rel="attachment wp-att-352" href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/?attachment_id=352"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-352" src="/assets/images/102910_0407_TheLimitofO1-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="185" /></a>The new era of philanthropy is driven by objectivity. For the modern poverty interventionist and philanthropic investor, we want proof our interventions create real, measurable social impact. Indeed, the shift in language away from <em>donor</em> in favor of <em>investor</em> is emblematic of a collective desire for objectivity.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits of increasing objectivity in a sector that has historically been burdened by anecdotes, objectivity has its limits. Sean Stannard-Stockton wrote a post on his Tactical Philanthropy blog about the <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/10/the-rise-of-issue-agnostic-philanthropy">Rise of Issue-Agnostic Philanthropy</a>. Issue-agnostic investing is where a funder invests in agencies where she will have the greatest impact, irrespective of philanthropic focus.</p>
<p>I'm all for outcomes-oriented social investing. A focus on outcomes and social impact not only helps move funds toward organizations implementing proven interventions, it also incentivizes organizations to objectively evaluate their own work. To that end, I fully support agency-agnostic investing, where a funder invests in the most effective organization in a particular region that focuses on a specific issue.</p>
<p>But the idea of issue-agnostic philanthropy illustrates the true limit of objectivity. The decision to give originates from an inherently subjective sense of social responsibility. Taken to its logical extreme of truly being agnostic, how would one even decide what investments are philanthropic? If an investor's single goal was impact magnitute, that investor would probably be better served investing in a massive for-profit than any charitable organization.</p>
<p>In fact, the idea of issue-agnostic philanthropy could create a dangerous incentive in the social sector. If all funders focused on was big impact regardless of focus area, funders would drive funds away from harder to solve problems, like chronic homelessness, into more superficial yet easier to impact causes.</p>
<p>Deciding what focus area to invest in is the most important decision a social investor makes. That decision is the one where the investor decides what change she wants to see in the world. I can see how objectivity is valuable at the point of selecting agencies to implement one's social vision, but how could the social vision itself ever be objectively chosen?</p>
<p>How can one honestly decide between investing in the environment versus poverty, objectively? We suck at comparing the impact of two anti-poverty programs, how can we possibly claim to be able to compare the impact of a particular poverty intervention against the social value of planting a tree? It's an impossible premise.</p>
<p>While our sector has benefited from drawing some inspiration from financial investing, social investing is still a very different, unique practice. In for-profit investing an investor can more easily be industry-agnostic because to the financial investor, monetary gain, not industry progress, is the driver of the investment. But in the social sector, the impact we seek is issue-specific, making it impossible for philanthropic investments to be issue-agnostic.</p>

        <p><a href="/assets/images/pay.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-343" src="/assets/images/pay-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" /></a>We have covered a bit of the <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/10/questions_that_matter/">back and forth</a> between Ken Burger from Charity Navigator and Dan Pallotta regarding executive compensation on this site. I even offered <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/04/executive-payback/">my own two cents</a> on the topic back in April.</p>
<p>In his reply to Dan Pallotta, Ken Burger writes that there is a compensation issue greater than that of what we are paying the people at the top of the ticket. Ken argues the real compensation crisis we face is the low wages front-line social sector staff receive. He <a href="http://www.kenscommentary.org/2010/09/nonprofit-leadership-money-isnt.html">writes</a> “...Boards and CEO’s should focus on retaining, promoting and rewarding those who perform and deliver vital direct services to people in need.”</p>
<p>I had a customer a little while back who was the executive director of a mid-sized social service agency. She would often complain that her employees were “idiots”. And she was right, they were (I didn’t think much of her either however).</p>
<p>The executive director’s agency was experiencing intense growth. The board was presumably happy with the multitude of new grants the agency was securing, and its expanding service repertoire.</p>
<p>The agency had hit a point where it needed to increase the quality of its human capital, not the size of its staff. But with each new grant came at least one new hire.</p>
<p>I wondered why the executive director kept hiring new people at relatively low wages. It seemed to me the organization’s money would be better spent hiring fewer people who could command higher salaries and add more value.</p>
<p>However, the grants the agency was securing left the executive director no room to negotiate employee salaries. Each new grant funded a new program, and with it a new position. Therefore, while the agency was awash in grant monies, it had no significant discretionary budget with which to reward higher performance.</p>
<p>The agency could not hire fewer people at higher wages even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>This is a serious issue for the social sector. We need to rethink the way we structure grant requirements. Executive management should have the freedom to use their agencies’ funds to compete for front-line talent. In order to do that, funders need to loosen their grip on guiding exactly how funds are used.</p>
<p>The overburden of funding restrictions renders moot the argument over executive compensation. The intensive regulations and particular stipulations of how grant monies can be used make the difference between Steve Jobs and a puppy with a fedora negligible. If executive management does not have the discretion to do what is in the best interest of its agency with the money it has, then it doesn’t really matter who runs our non-profits.</p>
