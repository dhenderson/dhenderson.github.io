      <article class="post-content">
        <p>I participated in my first Google Hangout last Friday on the topic of using data in homeless services. The discussion was organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/hardlynormal">Mark Horvath</a>, a homeless advocate and founder of <a href="http://invisiblepeople.tv/">Invisible People</a>. The call included Mark, myself, and three other practitioners with experience applying metrics in homeless services. You can check out the recording of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=UUh4pyZUB0mNzieaKv831flA&amp;v=KkxRofgehfc&amp;feature=player_embedded">conversation here</a>.</p>
<p>I was clearly the outlier on the panel as I work with a range of organizations on a variety of issues, so while homeless services is a <i>part </i>of my work, the other folks on the hangout are fully focused on working with those experiencing homelessness, and it shows in their depth of knowledge.</p>
<p>There were a lot of interesting take aways from the conversation, so I’ll likely be referring back to this discussion in future blog posts. But one thing that stood out to me was that the conversation reflected on both the <i>opportunities</i> and the <i>risks</i> of using data in homeless services, a point that applies to all possible uses of outcomes data in the social sector.</p>
<p>At one point in the discussion, our attention turned to the possibility that homeless service providers could use <i>predictive analytics</i> to exclude people from receiving services. Before I go any further, let me describe what I mean by predictive analytics.</p>
<p><b>Predicative analytics</b></p>
<p>Predictive analysis is the process of using historical data to try to predict what will happen in the future. There are various types of statistical techniques for doing this, but the basic idea is you try to fit a model that explains what happened to a set of observations in an existing data set. You then use that model to try to predict what will happen to a new set of people you don’t have any data on.</p>
<p>For example, your model might suggest that people who have a criminal background are more likely to get evicted from housing.</p>
<p>On the one hand you might use this finding to provide additional supportive services to keep people with criminal background in housing, on the other hand you might choose to exclude people from your housing program who have criminal backgrounds, which brings us back to a worry my co-panelists raised on the Google Hangout.</p>
<p><b>Same data, different decisions</b></p>
<p>Limited resources is a fact of life, which makes it particularly important that organizations develop intelligent ways of <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2013/02/25/service-rationing-and-strategic-queuing/">rationing their services</a> that maximize the social value they aim to create. So does that necessarily mean we should use data to weed out those that are hardest to serve?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>People make decisions, not data. Two people can look at the same data, the same sound analysis, and make two different decisions. One organization might decide to not serve a certain target demographic because they believe those individuals would not fare well in their program, but another organization might decide <i>the exact opposite</i>, reasoning that because those individuals have poorer prospects and risk worse outcomes, that they should be a higher priority.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is exactly what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_Vulnerability_Index">vulnerability index</a> does. The vulnerability index is essentially a triage tool for prioritizing chronically homeless people into housing. The more vulnerable someone is, the higher priority they are to house.</p>
<p>My point is not to argue that it is better to serve those who are more or least vulnerable, but rather to illustrate that data is a tool that helps us make decisions that are consistent with our own values.</p>
<p>While data can help us better assess what has happened and what might happen in the future, it does not tell us what to do. The decisions we make should be informed by data, but data does not make decisions for us.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p>I have a pretty low opinion of nonprofit consultants. Most days I use the sorry state of nonprofit consulting as a rallying cry to be a better consultant myself, but every now and then I wonder whether I wouldn’t be better off working <i>in</i> a social sector organization, rather than trying to shout above the crowded mess of nonprofit consultant stew.</p>
<p>Like a pack of rats, us nonprofit consultants stick together. One such consultant posted an article that popped up in my LinkedIn feed last week decrying the use of jargon in the nonprofit sector. The <a href="http://trust.guidestar.org/2013/03/15/words-to-avoid-2013-edition/">article</a> this consultant shared, a cross post from a <a href="http://www.bigducknyc.com/">nonprofit marketing blog</a> on Guidestar, railed against the use of terms like “optimize” and “impact”, arguing these terms are nothing more than impressive sounding hot air.</p>
<p>I understand the author’s intent, and to be fair the author does preface his list of “buzzwords” to avoid with the caveat that “If any word on the list is truly the most effective choice for reaching your reader, please go ahead and use it”. But I think ultimately what the Guidestar post illustrates is the difference between <i>jargon</i> and <i>terminology</i>.</p>
<p><b>Jargon versus terminology</b></p>
<p>I use the terms “optimize” and “impact” all the time in my work, two no-no’s from the cross-posted Guidestar piece. When I refer to optimization, I use it in the context of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear optimization</a>; one of the analytic techniques we use in my firm’s consulting work. And when I refer to impact, I use the definition from the evaluation academic literature.</p>
<p>To me, these terms are useful as they have precise meanings. Indeed, pretty much every field, from medicine to law to engineering, has its own set of terminology. Terminology is valuable as it provides shorthand for people versed in a particular specialty to speak succinctly.</p>
<p>Terminology becomes jargon when people use terminology because it sounds awesome without knowing what those terms mean. This brings us back to the state of nonprofit consulting and my inner conflict.</p>
<p><b>Nonprofit consulting sucks</b></p>
<p>I have a specialized skillset around data analytics, program evaluation, and computer programming. These are skills that are useful to a lot of organizations and take a while to develop (and maintain). However, they are skills that are not that useful to most social sector organizations in a full-time capacity, which is why I started my own consulting firm rather than joining a non-profit.</p>
<p>The blurring of the lines between terminology and jargon allows frauds to hide amidst those with real specializations. Many of these consultants, like wolves in sheep skins, are self-styled marketers posing as program evaluators, “data gurus”, or strategists (my gosh, <i>so many</i> strategists…).</p>
<p>Consultants can be really valuable. There are a lot of specializations that don’t make sense for organizations to employ fulltime, and consulting arrangements allow for people with specialized skills to affordably provide expertise to multiple organizations.</p>
<p>But too few nonprofit consultants are focusing on building skills. Indeed:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>To my fellow <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23nonprofit">#nonprofit</a> consultants, if you are keeping your "skills sharp" by reading blogs, you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>— David Henderson (@david_henderson) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_henderson/status/314178049178476545">March 20, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The blogosphere, like nonprofit consulting, is full of <i>jargon</i> as real meaning is not easily transferred in short bursts. Skills are developed through time, through significant work experience, <a href="http://philanthropy.com/article/5-Simple-Questions-to-Ask/137743/">reliable research</a>, and professional (i.e. academic) instruction.</p>
<p>Instead of purging terminology from our lexicon, we should instead be expelling those who confuse jargon with knowledge from the social sector.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p>People hate standing in line, and just about everyone in the social sector loathes having to decide who should receive a particular intervention and who should not. But service rationing and queuing are facts of life, and taking a sophisticated approach to how we prioritize services can make a substantial difference in a program's net impact.</p>
<p>I take an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">operations research</a> approach to program effectiveness. In this framework, each program aims to maximize a social good (or minimize some harm) given a set of constraints. Constraints come in many forms, including financial and time constraints.</p>
<p>Most of the organizations I work with, particularly human service organizations, have to ration their programs. For example, a homeless shelter only has so many beds and might have more demand for beds than supply in any given night. Food, tutoring, vaccinations, and many other types of social interventions have to manage scarcity daily.</p>
<p>So how do we prioritize who gets food, or who has a place to sleep tonight and who doesn't? Typically I see organizations adopt a first-come first served approach, but this approach doesn't always generate the best outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, let's say a homeless shelter has nine beds and ten people need a place to stay, the first nine get in and the tenth person doesn't. Seems fair, right?</p>
<p>But what if the first nine people are healthy men in their twenties who have been homeless for one night, and the tenth person is an eighty year old chronically homeless man who faces the possibility of death spending one more night on the street?</p>
<p>Assuming this shelter in question prioritizes minimizing life lost, the rational thing to do in this case would be to abandon the first-come first-serve prioritization model and to ensure a bed for the eighty-year old, turning down one of the nine people in their twenties.</p>
<p>This example illustrates that primitive rationing algorithms don't properly optimize organizations' intended outcomes, and can have unintended consequences for more vulnerable persons.</p>
<p>A better way is to develop a rationing system that aims to maximize the outcomes most important to the implementing organization. If the organization in our example aims to minimize life lost due to homelessness, then its shelter waitlist should recognize this preference.</p>
<p>Now, the shelter could ensure that it always has beds for the most vulnerable homeless persons by always turning away younger, healthier homeless persons. But this strategy would risk going nights where the shelter has empty beds, which wouldn't optimally use the shelter's resources, as the shelter might prefer that a healthy homeless person occupy a shelter bed than no one at all.</p>
<p>So the question then is, how do we make sure we prioritize more vulnerable persons while still trying to minimize the number of empty beds at the end of each evening? If you guessed data, I must be getting predictable.</p>
<p>Specifically, we would use concepts from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a>, utilizing historical data on what types of people come during what times of the year to try to build a model that changes prioritization based on the time of year, staffing levels, and perhaps even hour of day (for example, the shelter might have lower entry thresholds later in the evening to ensure maximum occupancy). This is the same type of approach that business like restaurants and airlines use to allocate their scare resources, except instead of maximizing profits we are maximizing social outcomes.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk, and plenty of nonsense, around how data is supposed to revolutionize the philanthropic sector. I think this focus on <em>revolution</em> is misplaced. Instead, approaches like the one outlined in this post can help us get incrementally more effective. Indeed, the real promise of data is not to show us we have been wrong all along, but instead to provide suggestions as to how we can improve. Strategic service rationing and queuing is a great place to start.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p>With every organization I work with, I begin the consulting engagement by developing an <em>impact theory</em>. The impact theory is the portion of the <em>theory of change</em> that identifies the causal assumptions of how a set of social interventions is expected to drive particulars social outcomes.</p>
<p>The impact theory is important because it sets the basis for how a program defines success, and how it intends to get there. Used correctly, the impact theory sets boundaries around what data points an organization’s survey instruments should collect.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.idealistics.org/">Idealistics</a> we use a database system we developed to model an organization’s impact theory. We call this system the <em>Decision Framework</em>, as it models the decision relevant factors an organization faces in trying to maximize social outcomes.</p>
<p>When I put together an impact theory, I spend time speaking with program directors and staff, hearing from them what they believe differentiates their program offerings. I’m most interested in identifying what they believe would be different in the lives of those they serve were their particular program not to exist. In evaluative speak, this is called the <em>counterfactual</em>.</p>
<p>A large service provider I am working with emphasizes the customer service aspect of their work, which includes traditional basic needs human services offerings like clothing, food, and medical services. Many of these services are available in other forms, provided by alternative agencies. However, this organization argues its interventions are unique not just because of the services offered, but the way in which people are treated when receiving assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service</strong></p>
<p>Social interventions tend to be defined as tangible outputs like medical vaccinations, counseling hours, and food baskets. While traditionally we think about interventions as activities or items that are plainly enumerable, can the <em>way</em> an output is delivered be an intervention in itself?</p>
<p>Brands differentiate themselves on service quality in the marketplace all the time, and charge a premium for it. While we all prefer not to be treated like crap, does better customer service drive better social outcomes? The impact of customer service on social outcomes is an empirical question which likely varies depending on what outcomes an organization intends to affect.</p>
<p>If good customer service is identified as a causal element in driving a set of outcomes, customer service needs to be operationalized to something we can measure, so we can evaluate the possible relationship between intended outcomes and quality customer care.</p>
<p>While an organization might assume there is a positive relationship between good customer service and positive social outcomes, the more interesting is how should an organization respond if the relationship between customer service and positive outcomes does not bear out?</p>
<p><strong>The value of not being a jerk</strong></p>
<p>Ideally everyone would be treated well, and no one would act like a jerk while administering social programs.<strong></strong></p>
<p>But what if customer service made no difference in the outcomes an organization was trying to drive, and good customer service came with a cost? If you could only treat half the number of people with good customer service than with crappy service, but otherwise get the same result, which is the optimal choice?</p>
<p>As we move toward a data driven social sector, these are the kinds of questions we will face, especially if the evidence runs contrary to our prior beliefs. It is easy to assume there is value in providing good customer service (which there might be), but we make a lot of assumptions all the time that on face seem intuitive, all to later uncover unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Used properly, evaluative metrics can help guide organizations make more impactful program decisions, but the real test is how we will react when data suggests what we are doing might be wrong.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p>The hype over data has become deafening. Small non-profits are obsessed with leveraging big data, and foundations are on the hunt to find the one evaluative metric to rule them all.</p>
<p>We need to take a breath.</p>
<p>Data offers some exciting opportunities in our sector. Predictive algorithms are really good at helping Amazon.com figure out when to sell me things I do not need. So too can we use predictive analysis for social good, like trying to predict the likelihood that a low-income teen will become homeless.</p>
<p>But data is not the end all be all. It is not our savior, and machines do not (and should not) make decisions.</p>
<p>Data, regression, machine learning, etc. are all tools that we can (and should) be using. And while these tools can help <em>illuminate</em> the path forward, they are not <em>the path forward</em>.</p>
<p>The debate around data has become unnecessarily dichotomous and fractious. There should be no debate between people versus data, man versus machine. There is no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>.</p>
<p>Those who argue that data is all that matters are equally as wrong as those who say it is all about the people. In the social sector, it ought to be all about achieving social outcomes, and toward that end you need good people <em>and</em> good data.</p>
<p>Importantly, we need to do a better job of teaching our <em>people</em> the promise and pitfalls of <em>data</em>. As we look to incorporate more data into social sector decision making, our organizations need to be better integrated than simply having the so-called data-nerds in one room and social sector specialists in the other.</p>
<p>If we are to become savvy users of data, it is essential that we raise the level of data-literacy for all organizational decision makers.</p>
<p>As things stand now, with so much data-hype, it is far too easy for anyone with a spreadsheet to win an argument, even if they are wrong. Indeed, I often worry that my customers do not question my own analysis enough, or that they assume causation where there is none.</p>
<p>Data is no hero. But people can be. We are more likely to be heroes if we work with the data, but data alone will not save us from anything. Used incorrectly, it has the potential to make things worse.</p>
