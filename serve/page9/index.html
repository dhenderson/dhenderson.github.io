        <p>At the end of last month <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/07/30/operationalize-optimize-then-advertise-your-outcomes/">I wrote a post</a> advising organizations to setup their evaluation frameworks prior to advertising their greatness to the world, as credible evidence to back up claims of effectiveness is infinitely more persuasive than the alternative. In the post I gave an example of a consultant who helped a former customer of mine create a logic model with poorly defined outcomes, positioning my customer for advertisement rather than measurement. From the post:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="background-color: white;">One such consultant, who I was later hired to replace to clean up his mess, outlined a data collection strategy that included an outcome of "a healthy, vibrant community free of crime where all people are treated with respect and dignity."<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; background-color: white;">What an operationalization nightmare. How the heck do you measure that? You don't. And that's the point. The logic model was not a functional document used for optimizing results. Instead, it was an advertising document to lull unsavvy donors into <em>believing</em> an organization is effective in the absence of evidence.<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Fair criticism, I think (obviously). Well, yesterday Jennifer Banks-Doll <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/07/30/operationalize-optimize-then-advertise-your-outcomes/">asked an even fairer question</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="background-color: white;">David, I really enjoy your blog and love the example you have given above about the unmeasurable outcome.  So true and so common!  But I feel like you've left us hanging...What kind of outcomes would you recommend instead?  Can you give us an example or two?</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent question, and while <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/07/30/operationalize-optimize-then-advertise-your-outcomes/">I did my best to give an example</a> of the right type of thought process an organization should go through to operationalize outcomes, unfortunately the best answer I can really give is the unsatisfying "it depends".</p>
<p>While there are those who tend to think through their logic models from left to right, that is, if I do this I expect that, I tend to think the other way around, starting with the goal an organization aims to achieve and moving backwards. There is nothing wrong with beginning the ideation process and goal setting with seemingly unmeasurable ideals. However, what begins as pie-in-the-sky should not be left there.</p>
<p>In my response to Jennifer's question, I gave the example of an organization trying to create a "safe" neighborhood. Safety is an inherently abstract notion. Part of safety might be actual incidences of crime, but safety might also have to do with perceptions as well. If someone feels unsafe in an area free of crime, is that area "safe"? Well, it depends on how an organization <em>defines</em> its goals.</p>
<p>In the process of creating more exacting definitions of the change you want to see in your target population, you get closer to identifying measurable indicators. The goal is not to create one measure for "safety", or whatever your outcome of interest is. Instead, what we want to do is come up with a few measures that collectively approximate what our otherwise abstracted outcome is.</p>
<p>One other note on this point. People tend to think that "measurable" necessarily means inherently enumerable. Working again with our safety example, one measure of safety might be crime rates, but another measure might be an opinion survey of residents in an area, asking them if they <em>feel</em> safe. If I had to choose one, my preference would be for the perception survey over the crime data.</p>
<p>Crime statistics, while numeric by nature, are not necessarily pure measures of "safety". If arrests increase in a neighborhood, this might be due to an increase in criminal activity, but it also might mean there are more police patrolling the area. Indeed, in some of the community development work I have done, I have found (in some cases) that perceptions of safety actually increase with the number of reported crimes.</p>
<p>The point I am trying to illustrate is that organizations should not feel pressure to use public data or seemingly more quantitative metrics if those are not good measures of your intended outcomes. The best indicators are those which most closely approximate measures of the change you want to see in the world. If the best way to get that data is asking people how they <em>feel</em> about a particular issue, then by all means, hit the streets.</p>

        <p>Google's advertising algorithm knows me too well. Pretty much the only advertisements I see now are for non-profit services. I tend to click through to these advertisements as a way of checking the pulse of social sector offerings outside the typical circles I operate in.</p>
<p>Yesterday I clicked on this advertisement for <a href="http://info.communitytech.net/npq-outcomes-offer?utm_campaign=NPQ-Rectangle&amp;utm_source=Banner%20Ad%20campaign">Apricot non-profit software by CTK</a>. The advertisement includes a product demonstration video for their outcomes management system in which the narrator conflates <em>outcomes</em> with <em>impact </em>ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Outcomes is not another word for impact. An outcome refers to a target populations' condition, impact is the change in that condition <em>attributable to an intervention</em>.</p>
<p>While we all tend to be saying the same buzz words ("manage to outcomes", "collective impact", etc.) we lack uniform agreement on what these terms mean. In the case of outcomes and impact, these are terms that come from the evaluation literature, and are (hopefully) not open to the manipulation of social sector consultancies with more depth in marketing than social science.</p>
<p>There are some that believe helping an organization at least understand its outcomes is a step in the right direction. I count myself as one of them. But telling an organization they can infer something about impact and causality by simply looking at a distribution of outcomes is not only irresponsible, it is downright dishonest.</p>
<p>The promise of metrics is to help the social sector move toward truer insight, not to use data to mislead funders. Whether the persistently misleading misuse of outcomes metrics is intentional or the result of ignorance, it has no place our work, and only stands to derail the opportunity we all have to raise the standards of evidence in our sector.</p>

        <p>On face, funding agencies providing grants contingent on implementing organizations meeting outcomes objectives seems sensible. After all, the sector is moving toward an era of smarter philanthropy and impact oriented giving, so shouldn't funders demand outcomes for their money?</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>I have been aware of this problem for some time, but was recently faced with an ethical dilemma when a customer asked me to help them adjust their program offerings to better achieve funder required outcomes.</p>
<p>The organization I was working with provides employment services to low-income individuals. Their grant stipulated that a certain number of program participants had to get placed in jobs in a given period of time. At first glance this seems to be a simple optimization problem where the employment program wants to maximize the number of people placed into employment.</p>
<p>Given this simplistic directive (place as many people as possible into employment), the optimization is actually quite trivial; serve the people most likely to get employment and ignore the hard to serve.</p>
<p>In this case, the hard to serve also tend to be those who need employment assistance the most. People with children might be harder to place into employment, given childcare needs, yet these individuals arguably <em>need</em> employment more than the otherwise equivalent person without dependent children.</p>
<p>Similarly, better educated people are easier to place into jobs than those with less education. But better educated people are more likely to find employment irrespective of the program intervention. This, of course, highlights the difference between <em>outcomes</em> and <em>impact</em>. The grant required improvements in <em>outcomes</em>, that is, the number of people placed into employment. When the focus is on outcomes, simple rationality dictates finding the most well-off persons who still qualify for services, and serving those folks first at the detriment of those who are harder to serve but in greater need.</p>
<p>While serving those who are better off first is rational given the way outcomes thresholds are typically written in grants, it probably does not lead to the desired outcome of the implementing organization (nor the intended outcome of the funder either!).</p>
<p>Hence my firm's ethical dilemma. By wanting our assistance in optimizing outcomes according to my client's funder's guidelines, our client was unwittingly asking us to help them identify and serve only those who didn't need their help that much to begin with. Our mission is to help organizations use metrics to help people better, and in this case, a data oriented approach given a misguided objective would likely lead to under-serving a hurting demographic.</p>
<p>Of course, this mess is nothing new, and is outside the control of implementing organizations. Funders requiring meaningless metrics of implementing organizations is not news. However, as funders try to press their grantees for more results, I am concerned that funders with a poor grasp of the difference between outcomes and impact, and insufficient knowledge to properly operationalize social indicators, will force implementing agencies to act in financially rational ways that end up hurting their target populations.</p>
<p>The answer to this problem is better data literacy in the social sector. My practice to date has focused on the data literacy of implementing agencies, but I'm worried that the zeal for more proof of social impact has underscored an open secret; both our front-line and grant-making institutions have a limited capacity to use data effectively.</p>
<p>And to those who say that some data is better than no data, I would argue that data is more like fire than we tend to realize. Fire has done incredible things for humanity, but those who do not know how to use it are likely to burn themselves.</p>

        <p>In the for-profit sector, profits are the bottom line. Yet companies spend considerable amounts of money trying to figure out whether their products work as advertised, whether their customers are happy, and what they can do to improve quality and customer satisfaction. While advertising drives sales of an effective product or service, smart organizations are careful to first figure out how to measure the effectiveness of their offerings with their target consumers (operationalization), optimize based on customer feedback, and then advertise.</p>
<p>In the social sector, we make up an intervention and then skip straight to advertising the hell out of it. No measurement plan, no operationalization of desired outcomes, and certainly no optimization (an impossibility if we aren't measuring our effectiveness to begin with).</p>
<p>While we are loath to operationalize, optimize, or do anything that rhymes with "evaluation", we love it when it rains advertisers. Our advertisers come in the form of grant writers, social-media-for-social-good consultants, and pretty much anyone willing to work on a retainer to tell an organization it's fantastic.</p>
<p>But how fantastic can we be without sensible data collection strategies? And how much can we improve if we continue to offer the same intervention year after year without improvements? The assumption is that the continued existence of an intervention is sufficient proof that a service is working and is valuable. Of course, this is the simple fallacy that always leads to the poor getting screwed, especially when their choice is between bad services and nothing.</p>
<p>The emphasis on advertising stems from agencies' survival instincts. Indeed, the primary function of any organization is to continue to exist. I get that. But the irony is that funders and donors are begging for any organization to step up with reliable metrics and believable outcomes.</p>
<p>As funders and donors have started to demand more evidence of impact from organizations, the usual suspects of advertising consultants have shifted their rhetoric (but not offerings) to appear more in line with the shifting philanthropic landscape. All of a sudden, non-profit marketing consultants with backgrounds in Russian literature and interpretive dance are qualified to help organizations craft logic models and develop rigorous data collection strategies.</p>
<p>One such consultant, who I was later hired to replace to clean up his mess, outlined a data collection strategy that included an outcome of "a healthy, vibrant community free of crime where all people are treated with respect and dignity."</p>
<p>!%#*</p>
<p>What an operationalization nightmare. How the heck do you measure that? You don't. And that's the point. The logic model was not a functional document used for optimizing results. Instead, it was an advertising document to lull unsavvy donors into <em>believing</em> an organization is effective in the absence of evidence.</p>
<p>The good news is that donors and funders are starting to get wise to the backward thinking "advertise first" mentality. The social sector is shifting, for the better, to reward organizations that take their data collection plans seriously, and who look to improve on their impact rather than simply advertise it to anyone willing to listen.</p>
<p>Organizations hoping to enjoy fundraising success in the future would be wise to invert their funding strategy to a model that emphasizes operationalization and optimization of outcomes first. In this new era of philanthropy, without evidence of impact, your advertising partners won't have anything to sell.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p>It's fairly typical for direct service organizations to lament that demand for services out paces supply. In the free market when demand exceeds supply sellers increase prices, as the seller's focus is maximizing profits.</p>
<p>In the social sector, our focus is maximizing social benefit, yet outside of the medical world (where triage dictates the worst of individuals capable of survival get treated first) there is no such rationalization around service rationing.</p>
<p>Through my work, I visted with two programs recently, one that supplies affordable housing vouchers for homeless individuals and another that places low-income youth in summer jobs with stipends. Both organizations face greater demand for services than they can afford, meaning they each have to turn a significant number of people away.</p>
<p>I asked both program directors how they decide who receives services, and in both cases they simply service people on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>The problem with first-come, first-served is that those who show up for services first might not be the best fit to <em>maximize</em> social welfare. Going back to the example of the for-profit world, if you have ten tickets to a concert to sell, and the first five people in line are willing to pay a dollar, and the next twenty are willing to pay thirty dollars each, you would deny the first five people and select the next twenty.</p>
<p>But in the social sector, when we select people on a first-come, first-served basis, we are willing to serve those who might need the service less, or be less likely to succeed, than if we selected someone else.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that we think about service rationing in terms of eligibility instead of social welfare maximization. If someone <em>qualifies</em> for our program, they are in, even if other indicators suggest that the selected individual might drop out of the program soon after enrollment, or that her or his need for the service is far more modest than the person behind them in line.</p>
<p>In order to maximize over social welfare, we have to define what social welfare means to us. This definition stems from the outcomes identified in your logic model's impact theory. In the case of the affordable housing program, the desired outcome might be to <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/06/21/minimizing-years-of-life-lost-due-to-homelessness/">minimize the number of years of life lost due to homelessness</a>. Under this framework, we would have a preference for serving individuals who are at a greater risk of lower life expectancy due to their homelessness, than simply taking every person who is homeless until vouchers run out.</p>
<p>The distinction I'm making here is eligibility (as being homeless makes you eligible), and what our social welfare maximization framework is. The social welfare maximization framework gives us a way of prioritizing service delivery between two individuals who otherwise qualify for services.</p>
<p>In the case of the youth workforce development program, while all low-income youth would qualify for services, we might have a preference for placing people into the program who are likely to complete the internship. In this case, one could use historical data to fit a predictive model that provides some insight into what characteristics made an individual more or less likely to have completed the program in the past. Under this framework, social welfare maximization would involve not only placing people into the program, but maximizing the number of people in the program who complete the internship.</p>
<p>Supply and demand issues have long plagued the social sector, in both economic booms and busts. Therefore, we need to be smarter about how we allocate our scarce resources. The first step in better allocation of resources is a well defined impact theory that clearly identifies an organization's intended goals. From there, one can develop a utility maximizing framework that learns from historical data to better optimize allocations through time.</p>
