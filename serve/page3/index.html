      <article class="post-content">
        <p style="color: #000000;"><a href="/assets/images/phone-recording.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1199" src="/assets/images/phone-recording-300x165.jpg" alt="phone recording" width="300" height="165" /></a>Transparency is a building block buzz-word of the social sector. While there seems to be general consensus that transparency is important, the <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2014/04/30/help-yourself-to-my-ideas/">proprietary actions of social sector actors</a> runs contrary to that idealized vision.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Given this imbalanced rhetoric to reality ratio, I was especially intrigued by Guidestar's new approach to sharing its progress with the public. Guidestar is experimenting with what it calls <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/rxg/about-us/guidestars-impact.aspx">"impact calls"</a>, quarterly webinars where the nonprofit's leadership discusses its finances, impact, and strategic road map. The concept of the impact call is modeled on the quarterly earning calls publicly traded companies hold for shareholders.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">On May 12 <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/">Guidestar</a> held its second quarterly impact call, the first I have had the opportunity to listen in on. The impact call provided a solid overview of the organization's finances and projected revenues, as well as a short and mid-term strategic road map, although the call was quite a bit lighter on actual <em>impact</em> reporting.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">During the call, Guidestar CEO Jacob Harold explained that Guidestar's impact assessment strategy is still evolving, and that the organization is developing an impact measurement dashboard it may present at the next impact call. The insinuation seems to be that as the impact measurement tool evolves, Guidestar will be better positioned to report its outcomes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Although I was disappointed not to hear much about Guidestar's impact on its impact call, I was nonetheless impressed with the concept and even found the sharing of less exhilarating (although more easily enumerated) metrics such as subscribers and web-usage statistics a great step toward real nonprofit transparency.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A criticism of earnings calls is that the quarterly reporting encourages companies to focus on short-term gains at the expense of long term progress. Guidestar CFO James Lum wisely cautioned that while Guidestar is committed to reporting quarterly results, the organization's focus is on its long-term strategy. I think this is the right sentiment to have, and hope Guidestar doesn't feel pressured over time to start optimizing for short-term gains to score favorable headlines in philanthropy media at the exense of the big picture.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>This should be a trend</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The impact call is an obnoxiously obvious idea. Everyone should be doing this, although I'm not sure many organizations will. Kudos to Guidestar for taking this step, I would love to see, at the very least, foundations follow suit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">While it would be great for every nonprofit to host quarterly impact calls, I'm not sure many folks would care to tune in. Guidestar is the right organization to pioneer this approach because many of its constituents are nonprofits themselves, and more likely to consume this type of information. Similarly, foundations (directly) invest in nonprofits, who would not only be interested in hearing more about how foundations think, but could benefit from learning about foundations' thought-processes, strategic planning, and overall claims of impact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Transparency is easy when you're winning. It will be interesting to see if this type of hyper-transparency holds when findings are less than stellar. The Hewlett Foundation has demonstrated a willingness to embrace this type of transparency in their recent decision to discontinue the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative, which they announced with the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/blog/posts/strengthening-our-sector">explanation that evaluators found " our grants have not made much of a dent"</a> in the intended outcomes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Publicizing wins <em>and</em> losses is the future of transparency. Impact calls are a compelling medium to communicate those findings. I look forward to the next Guidestar impact call, especially if the next call has more <em>impact</em> in it.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p style="color: #000000;"><a href="/assets/images/avis-test-broker-courtier-option-binaire-zeoption-624x468.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1194" src="/assets/images/avis-test-broker-courtier-option-binaire-zeoption-624x468-300x225.jpg" alt="Answer options" width="300" height="225" /></a>Selecting the right questions for your survey instruments can be tough. Equally difficult is identifying the right answer options for the questions you ask people. When selecting answer options, ideally you would provide enoughoptions to get some meaningful feedback and variation in responses, but not too many answer options as to overwhelm survey respondents.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before launching any survey instrument it's preferable to do what is called a survey <em>pretest</em>. A pretest is where you get a subsample of people who are like your intended survey audience, and you ask them for feedback on each of your survey questions and answer options. However, pretesting isn't always possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I've been working with a nonprofit called <a href="http://teamtassy.org/">Team Tassy</a> that provides workforce services to families in Menelas, Haiti. Team Tassy wanted to learn more about the employability of families in its targeted communities by conducting a survey at a free medical clinic day the organization sponsored.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One of the questions on the survey asked what work related skills each of the respondents possessed. The problem was that we didn't know whether we were providing the right answer options to the skills question.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ideally we would have pretested the question to get feedback on what types of skills should be included in the answer options. However, pulling together a focus group abroad would have provided logistical challenges, making pretesting less of a viable option.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Since we were not able to pretest the answer options, instead Team Tassy took its best guess as to what the answer options should have been, and provided an option for respondents to fill in any other skills not included as part of the question's answer options. We planned to use the free-form options to better learn what job skills options should have been included.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Team Tassy collected more than 250 surveys at the medical clinic it sponsored. Given the relatively large number of surveys, reading through each of the free-form answers wasn't completely practical. Instead, we built a word cloud of the free-form skills options to get a visual idea of what types of skills were most mentioned.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="/assets/images/additional_skills.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1191" src="/assets/images/additional_skills-300x266.png" alt="Skills word cloud" width="400" height="356" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The word cloud revealed that several individuals reported having merchant and dress making related skills, options that were not included among the original answer options. Going forward, Team Tassy will now include these options on future skills questions.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Word clouds are a pretty low-tech approach to data analysis. But they can be really effective, especially for getting quick feedback on what types of answer options you might included on your surveys.</p>

By the time I was wrapping up Idealistics, I thought about open sourcing the code I paid <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a> a monthly fee to keep private, all to realize it would have taken a <em>ton of effort</em> to get anyone to care that I was giving my software away for free.</p>
<p>If I had Idealistics to do again, I would have spent my energy spreading my ideas rather than paying to keep them secret.</p>
<p>I think there is a lot of value in being open regardless of the industry one is in, but there <em>certainly</em> is value in openness in the social sector. We're supposed to be in the business of solving social problems after all.</p>
<p>Given the value of openess, and general rallying cry around nonprofit transparency, I can't help but wonder why I've been coming across so many nonprofits intent on lawyering up to "protect" their intellectual property.</p>
<p>I've been doing a lot of contracting work recently. Really interesting stuff, and a bunch of insights that could probably help out a whole slew of social interventions. And I can't tell you about any of it. I'm contractually obligated not to.</p>
<p>The social sector exists in this weird space between the public and private sector. We run private entities intended for public benefit. In the process we develop proprietary solutions to public problems.</p>
<p>That last sentence makes my head hurt.</p>
<p>We need to make a decision as to what we are, and what we stand for. You can't have proprietary collective impact. The patent system is designed to allow companies to lock in competitive advantages to singularly reap the benefits of their investments over a period of time. Our investments are supposed to be public. So why the hell are startup social enterprises seeking patents on technological solutions to connect low-income families to social programs? Who benefits from those patents? Certainly not the public. Definitely not the poor.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to be working on an exciting range of contracts. While I'm under contract not to say anything about that work, going forward I'll certainly be more open about my own ideas, even if I intend to monetize them.</p>
<p>If my ideas are any good, and can actually create real social value, be my guest and help yourself to my ideas.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="/assets/images/CMOChallenges.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1184" alt="Chief data officer" src="/assets/images/CMOChallenges-262x300.jpg" width="262" height="300" /></a>I've been doing a lot of consulting recently, which has resulted in a several months long hiatus from writing on this site. Happily, my greater volume of consulting engagements has given me more opportunities to give people bad (and hopefully some good) advise, which means more content for Full Contact Philanthropy.</p>
<p>Recently I have been reflecting on some particularly bad advise I gave to one of my customers. Over the summer I was hired by a large provider of housing and homeless services to improve the operational speed at which chronically homeless clients were being placed into housing. The project went well, and by the end of the project the executive team was seeing the value data can bring to their organization on an ongoing basis</p>
<p>The executive director asked me to draft a memo outlining what the organization should look for in an internal analytics hire. Ideally, the executive said, the hire would be able to work both on social outcomes data as well as helping the development team improve its use of donor data. I advised the executive against hiring one person to oversee all of the organization's data needs, as I felt there was value in having specific domain experience (such as a background in homeless services or fundraising) before jumping into an issue specific data set.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>By telling the executive he should hire two different analysts, I scared him off of bringing in more data talent entirely, as I took what already looked like a budget sheet stretch (one new hire with a non-trivial skill set) to something completely out of reach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while domain experience is important, the organization <em>already had</em> sufficient internal domain expertise. The development folks know development really well. And the program team is top notch. What they didn't have was internal capacity in sifting through the volumes of data the organization collected each day.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to argue for hiring analysts who intimately know the organization's core mission, instead I should have advised a management structure where the development and program teams make data requests to a data team, allowing development and program staff to identify the right questions, and letting the data team (or individual to start) focus on answering those questions with the data available.</p>
<p>As I've thought about this issue further, and gotten a closer look at the data needs of both the program and development sides of nonprofits, the more I am convinced that having a Chief Data Officer (someone whose sole responsibility is focusing on the data needs of the entire organization) makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>The idea of a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/12/28/the-chief-data-officer-an-executive-whose-time-has-come/">Chief Data Officer has been growing in popularity in the for-profit world</a>. There are some nonprofits that have had success employing chief data officers as well. However, the idea of the Chief Data Officer has not permeated throughout the social sector. Instead, the nonprofits that have employed heads of data have more obviously quantifiable interventions, generally nonprofits that focus on measuring online engagement like <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/">DoSomething</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is an exciting, and much broader opportunity, for various types of organizations to bring in Chief Data Officers. Indeed, regardless of what your organization does, every organization (business, nonprofit, foundation, whatever) traffics in some sort of information. Given the importance of data, not just now but historically as well, a Chief Data Officer is as logical, and essential, a hire as good director of programs, development, and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>I've complained before that the rhetoric around data in the social sector is too hallow, and thinking too shallow. Part of the block in moving from concept to action in realizing the value of data is that organizations have not invested sufficiently in figuring out how data works in their managerial structures.</p>
<p>Mario Morino rightly encouraged the sector to think more intelligently about how to <a href="http://leapofreason.org/">manage to outcomes</a>. Managing to outcomes is not just about outcomes reporting software, but investing in people and process. I couldn't be more excited about the fact that my work is giving me the opportunity to help organizations think more seriously about how to build data cultures. It's a theme I'm passionate about and plan to expand on more in subsequent posts.</p>

        <p><a href="/assets/images/Incentives.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1180" alt="Incentives" src="/assets/images/Incentives-210x300.jpg" width="210" height="300" /></a>While the jury is out on the effectiveness of social impact bonds (SIB), the fundamental idea of rewarding investment in effective social interventions makes a lot of sense. That core tenant of social impact bonds is so compelling that I'm surprised such thinking has not spilled into the <a href="http://www.independentsector.org/charitable_deduction#sthash.cVjiDiFs.dpbs">charitable deduction debate</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, the charitable deduction allows donors to write-off investments in the betterment of society. But with <a href="http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/howmany.html">1.5 million nonprofits in the United States</a>, our definition of public benefit is broad, a point underscored by the clear divide in the types of charities <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/the-future-of-the-charitable-deduction/">middle income individuals donate to versus the wealthy</a>.</p>
<p>Borrowing from social impact bonds, I started thinking about a charitable deduction schedule that allowed donors to write-off <em>outcomes</em> rather than our current approach which limits donors to writing-off <em>inputs</em>.</p>
<p>Under this tax deduction scheme, charitable organizations' deduction rates would be tiered based on the marginal benefit of each additional dollar donated. The <em>marginal benefit</em> component allows the donation rate to be tempered not just based on societal outcomes (for example, Carnegie Mellon University has a good argument that its students create a lot of economic value, present company excluded), but what effect each <em>additional dollar</em> has on social outcomes. This caveat is similar to GiveWell's consideration of not just an organization's effectiveness, but also its <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability">room for additional funding</a>.</p>
<p>Tying charitable deductions to outcomes would open up much of the promise of SIB's to all nonprofits, allowing high functioning nonprofits to market higher deduction rates to potential donors. Obviously such an approach would be fraught with evaluative difficulties, although no more so than SIBs.</p>
<p>I have lamented in the past how our current funding environment rewards nonprofits for <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2012/09/19/if-you-had-to-choose-between-an-evaluator-or-a-marketer/">investing in marketing over outcomes</a>. A tier system that assigns deduction rates based on outcomes would better align organizations around maximizing social value. Wasn't that <a href="http://www.urban.org/url.cfm?ID=1000520&amp;renderforprint=1&amp;CFID=63376578&amp;CFTOKEN=23088794&amp;jsessionid=f030b2a0f830e269ef827525101735227d69">the point of the charitable deduction</a> in the first place?</p>
