<p>She asked some interesting questions about what comprises good evaluation, how to make evaluation accessible and affordable for organizations of all sizes, and what role government plays in social sector innovation and combating poverty.</p>
<p>The common thread throughout the interview is that the focus of evaluation needs to transition from a grading system used by would-be donors to a tool that helps organizations increase social outcomes.

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="/assets/images/morewithless.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-548" src="/assets/images/morewithless-250x167.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="167" /></a>About a month ago <a href="http://www.givingusareports.org/">Giving USA released a report</a> on charitable giving in 2010. The report found that on the whole charitable giving increased modestly in 2010 relative to the prior year.</p>
<p>While the philanthropic community received the report with guarded optimism, the report had decidedly bad news for organizations in the human services field. From 2009 to 2010, giving to human service organizations actually decreased 5.6%.</p>
<p>So while those concerned with philanthropy might have seen some silver lining, or perhaps down right good news in the numbers, from where I sit the findings were all bad.</p>
<p>You see, I'm not in the charitable sector, I'm in the ending poverty business. And while demand for social services have logically increased during a prolonged, hopefully not structural loss of American economic prowess, charitable giving to poverty focused organizations has dipped in tandem.</p>
<p>The funding environment is not going to improve any time soon, and if our economy does suffer a structural shift, it might not ever. Human services has never been the sexy cause of affluent philanthropists, who tend to favor health, arts, and higher education. Indeed, charitable giving in human services is largely driven by middle and lower-class households. Rounding out human services is government funding, a lot of it. Of course, that funding is being cut back substantially as governments slash budgets to stave off default.</p>
<p>The stark funding reality in the face of higher demand leaves only one choice. And no, that choice doesn't have anything to do with $3 dollar Twitter challenges and a hollow promise of social media fundraising success.</p>
<p>We need to get real, and getting real means doubling down on achieving social impact. The only way to do more with less is to get more efficient. Efficiency, of course, cannot be discerned without reliable ways of measuring if what we do actually works.</p>
<p>Housing First, which advocates placing chronically homeless persons into housing rather than trying to treat them while living in the streets, caught on as a solution because it demonstrably houses hurting people while simultaneously decreasing the social cost of homelessness.</p>
<p>This is the kind of innovation we need to pursue, one that is driven by facts and inherently measurable. Sense we can measure the effectiveness of Housing First, we can regularly monitor whether the strategy actually makes social <em>and</em> economic sense. Discerning both the social and fiscal impact of any program must be a prerequisite, especially as funding gets increasingly more difficult to come by.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the changing economic landscape necessitates a shift in the way the social sector operates. I'm afraid the over-emphasis on online fundraising and corporate media challenges only serves to distract from the stark truth; it's time we hunker down on identifying what works, and cutting what doesn't.</p>
<p>Of course, if we are to focus our efforts only on solutions that work, we'll need better ways of measuring success.</p>
<p>Measurement though, I've come to learn, has less to do with a solid set of equations and more to do with an organization's culture. Historically, our sector has a culture of emphasizing increasing revenues over monitoring impact. In the current funding environment, that strategy no longer cuts it.</p>
<p>If our ultimate goal is to end poverty, we have to face the fact that growing the funding pot is not presently a strategy we can pursue. Instead, we will have to do more with less. In order to do that, we have to focus on what works, seriously evaluate our own efforts, and have the courage of our convictions to put the needs of suffering people above the monetary ambitions of our interventions of choice.</p>

        <p><a href="/assets/images/networkeffect.bmp"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-520" src="/assets/images/networkeffect.bmp" alt="" /></a>Growing up I didn’t care much for superhero stories. In order for there to be a hero there necessarily has to be a victim. I figured since no one really wants to be the victim, I should not aspire to be a hero.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why I’ve never been entirely comfortable with the traditional community service model of the enabled case manager providing services to the debilitated service recipient. There are several inherent problems with this traditional framing, not least of which is that the model defines service recipients by their needs rather than assets. Just as it is better to define words by their properties rather than lack thereof, so too should all people be defined affirmatively.</p>
<p>In keeping with this intention of positive definition, one of the things that defines all people regardless of economic standing is our social networks. However, positive network effects do not fit neatly into the standard community service narrative. Instead, we ignore the possibility that positive network effects can co-exist in poverty, assuming the poor are better removed from their networks all together, perhaps in favor of inclusion in a more affluent, mixed-income community.</p>
<p>I recently read an excellent article by Katya Smyth, founder of the <a href="http://fullframeinitiative.org/">Full Frame Initiative</a>, in the Foundation Review titled <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-06-23/bqeEEtEAjBwzCCJdtlpwdAtpgCdEkbmoiFsCzwrvfofEFCEjpdecsqmmgrlG/TFR_2_4_Smyth_SocialNetworks.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJFZAE65UYRT34AOQ&amp;Expires=1309921240&amp;Signature=gNDi1gzlfTATf5Tr6LlKtGMwPNI%3D">“Leveraging Social Networks in Direct Services”</a>. Katya argues that service providers do their clients a disservice by trying to treat symptoms in isolation, without utilizing the benefits of the greater social context and networks in which all people operate.</p>
<p>Indeed, social outcomes might very well be enhanced were social networks leveraged, rather than eschewed, in service delivery. That is part of the premise behind the <a href="http://fiinet.org/">Family Independence Initiative</a>, which promotes the benefits of poor families working together within their own defined networks to lift themselves, and one another, out of poverty.</p>
<p>These ideas are natural permutations of the lending circle concept pioneered in microcredit.  Lending circles are not organized by the lenders, but instead by the borrowers who build their own networks to both ensure the borrowing group does not default, but also to establish a supportive network and pooled resources that financially benefit all participants.</p>
<p>While there are obvious untapped opportunities in utilizing the existing networks of those in poverty, so too should interventions aim to positively augment social circles where possible. In Katya’s article she notes that in professionalized social services as they exist today, a case manager is more likely to try to help an individual secure employment by sending out dozens of resumes to anonymous employers rather than leveraging existing contacts and relationships. In this case, the missed opportunity is not just a failure to rely on the social network of the job seeker, but more broadly the interventionist’s reluctance to extend her own network to those she serves.</p>
<p>Network augmentation is fundamentally at the core of Mark Horvath’s <a href="http://wearevisible.com/">We Are Visible</a>, which aims to connect unhoused persons with a broader community through social media. Mark has recently received some criticism that although his focus is on homelessness, many of the people who follow him on Twitter and partner in his efforts are not homeless themselves. Considering that the intent of his intervention is to empower unhoused persons with a broader social network, those criticism fall flat, as network strength is in part a function of network heterogeneity.</p>
<p>While the current thinking around social networks and the social sector is stuck in low-gear on simplistic social media advice for non-profits, the real power of networks is in helping people lift themselves out of poverty. My hope is that social media can catalyze wider thinking on the value of networks generally, as the true value of network effects is in the enumeration of poverty reduction, rather than number of followers of a Twitter account.</p>

        <p><a href="/assets/images/20110623-104643.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full" src="/assets/images/20110623-104643.jpg" alt="20110623-104643.jpg" /></a>The social sector is abuzz with the bruhaha over the proper role evaluation should play. There are some who argue evaluation is all important, that every intervention is guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p>Others, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-lewis/social-impact-evaluation-_b_881296.html">like Jonathan Lewis</a>, have taken the mantel of evaluation skeptic, arguing that it is the intervention, not the evaluation, that is paramount.</p>
<p>Personally, I have grown tired of the evaluation debate. The more interesting question, not only to me but to those who (allegedly) benefit from the services of the social sector, is how can evaluation make interventions more effective?</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a different question than the core query driving the debate in philanthropy circles. Those who identify on the philanthropy side (which despite the title of this blog, I do not) think about evaluation as a tool for deciding what to invest in.</p>
<p>While evaluation can, and should, inform investment decisions, the brighter promise of evaluation is in informing the decisions of implementers. In this way, I think about evaluation in two tiers, one that provides shorter term ongoing feedback to interventionists and another that is longer-term, and more exhaustive in scope to prove or disprove impact.</p>
<p>Although this grander, longer term, up or down, live or die evaluation is seen by some as the sole objective of evaluation, the fact is we are a long ways off (if we will ever get there) of having such reliable binary indicators.</p>
<p>What we are equipped to do is develop interim, iterative indicators that can inform implementers of whether their interventions are headed in the right direction, and more importantly, how to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>But in the current environment of philanthropist driven evaluation furor, imperfect evaluation techniques have been mistaken for reliable crystal balls. This has had a chilling effect on implementing agencies, as daring to use evaluation for tactical purposes creates the political liability that negative results can lead to loss of funding.</p>
<p>In the business world, investors invest in competent people with vision. Those people, the day to day managers, use a myriad of techniques to improve products and raise profits. One such tried and true technique is hiring consultants to evaluate any number of parts of their businesses.</p>
<p>Smart investors do not parachute in, scoop up an isolated internal memo, and use that to decide whether the company is going to hell or not.</p>
<p>Yet that is what we risk doing so long as we position evaluation as a threat to implementing organizations. ultimately, the issue is not how implementing organizations nor philanthropist funders feel about their investments or interventions, all that matters is what happens on behalf of those in need.</p>
<p>The best way to help people better is to foster an environment where seeking information and changing behaviors as a result is rewarded rather than de-funded.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="/assets/images/horse.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-496" src="/assets/images/horse-250x187.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="187" /></a><a href="http://dowser.org/social-impact-bonds-a-revolution-in-government-funding/">Social Impact Bonds</a> are the darling of the minute in the social sector. Another day, another push to pretend the social sector is a damsel in distress, only to be saved by the brawn and brilliance of public-sector innovations.</p>
<p>The problems Social Impact Bonds aim to address are real. There are limited financial resources available for social interventions, and we do need to figure out ways to maximize impact per dollar.</p>
<p>Social Impact Bonds attempt to do this by tying returns on investment to outcomes indicators. When an investor purchases a bond in a particular social program, she receives her principal plus an additional monetary return if the agency she invests in yields measurable results. If the agency fails to meet its outcomes threshold, the investor loses her money.</p>
<p>These bonds would be backed by the government, which would theoretically only be obligated to pay for successful social interventions. The intended benefits are</p>
<ul>
<li>The government only pays for what works</li>
<li>New money enters the system as social impact bond investors seek profits</li>
<li>Non-profits are incentivized to achieve impact</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is not clear how different social impact bonds are from the status quo. Funders already require organizations to demonstrate their outcomes. It is unlikely investors are going to be able to do that any better than existing foundation and government grant review committees. Indeed, the real problem of course is ambiguous and non-uniform evaluation criterion, plus the general lack of capacity to monitor impact.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the argument that Social Impact Bonds will bring new money into the sector is an empirical point yet to be seen rather than a logical conclusion. Social investors already get financial benefits in the form of tax write-offs at zero risk. I’m not saying the risk/reward of Social Impact Bonds won’t work, but let’s not be so sure they will, either.</p>
<p>Ultimately, ideas like Social Impact Bonds and non-profit market exchanges that mirror the world of finance dance around, rather than address, the core issues facing the social sector. Investors are a necessary part of a functioning for-profit or non-profit sector, but innovation and execution is king.</p>
<p>We are so enamored of the giving and investing aspects of philanthropy, yet our eyes glaze when the charts and logic models come out. Designing investing models and website that connect us with our favorite causes are so exceptionally beside the point when we lack the cohesions and capacity to measure impact.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder those who focus on the giving side of philanthropy gloss over the implementation aspects. Actually helping people is hard, but giving sure feels great. So too, does making bold claims about how we should only give to effective organizations.</p>
<p>But what does effective mean, and how do we measure it? Those are the questions that actually matter, and without real answers, funding models are not going to make a lick of difference.</p>
