      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="/assets/images/zuckerpoor.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-329" src="/assets/images/zuckerpoor-199x300.png" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Last Friday, the movie <a href="http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/">The Social Network</a>, a semi-fictional account of Facebook’s founding and the drama and backbiting that followed, debuted to strong reviews. Social networking is a big part of a lot of people’s lives, and has become a part of the social sector.</p>
<p>Non-profits try to raise money online through applications like <a href="http://causes.com/">Causes</a>, and philanthropy folks use social networks to connect with one another and share ideas (many of you are likely reading this post because you saw it pop up in one of your social streams).</p>
<p>We have covered on this site some of the <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/07/where-social-media-doesnt-matter/">pitfalls that social media</a> and emerging technologies present in the social sector when used in <a href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2009/11/why-im-not-extraordinary/">ridiculous ways</a>. By and large though, I do believe social networking has been a benefit to those of us in the social sector. But what about the recipients of it and the issues we care about?</p>
<p>Much has been made of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">digital divide</a>, the technological schism between the privileged, educated, wired elite and people struggling to get by. If the social sector exists to address human issues that impact those with the least amongst us, and those people are not online, then what the heck are we (me) doing Tweeting and posting on Facebook throughout our days?</p>
<p>Bill Easterly, a self-anointed king of development common sense seems to do nothing but post to <a href="http://aidwatchers.com/">his blog</a> and send unanswered shots at Jeffery Sachs. Is this God’s work?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I am a consumer of Easterly’s venom. But if the point of the social sector is to solve social problems, shouldn’t we focus on connecting to people in need and affecting real issues? Does social networking have any real ability to create social impact?</p>
<p>Malcom Gladwell in a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all#ixzz11LLwYaZz">recent piece</a> in The New Yorker magazine argues that it doesn’t. Gladwell writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Gladwell’s argument ignores a critical counter example David Kilkpatrick writes about in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439102112?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fullcontaphil-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439102112&quot;">The Facebook Effect</a>. Kilkpatrick recounts the story of how a Colombian activist organized mass protests against the violent brutality of the guerrilla organization known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia">FARC</a>, organizing <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2008/0204/p04s02-woam.html">massive protests</a> in cities across the world.</p>
<p>But the FARC example only demonstrates that people connected online can effectively advocate for themselves. We in the social sector focus on empowering others. So while I don’t buy Gladwell’s argument that social networking categorically cannot effect social change, I think there are serious limitations, especially when the people we aim to serve are absent from online social networks.</p>
<p>My friend Mark Horvath, popularized on Twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hardlynormal">@hardlynormal</a> is trying to push the bounds of social networking’s reach by bringing homeless people online to Twitter and Facebook. Mark <a href="http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2010/03/congratulations-invisible-people-tv-for-winning-the-pepsi-sxsw-challenge.html">won a Pepsi Refresh challenge</a> to create a website called <a href="http://wearevisible.com/">We Are Visible</a>, which teaches unhoused persons how to get online, and aims to connect them with virtual case managers.</p>
<p><a href="http://wearevisible.com/">We Are Visible</a> is a new project, so its success remains to be seen, but I like the general idea behind it of breaking down the digital divide. Regardless, the reality is that much of our work has to be offline, since the people we serve are by definition more isolated than ourselves.</p>
<p>Social networking has been a great benefit to the social sector, and to me as a professional. It has given me the opportunity to learn from and interact with practitioners that would have been inaccessible to me otherwise. This in turn has made the work I do in the communities I serve better, resulting in a real-world, offline impact.</p>
<p>Social networking is a tool, it is not an end all to social harms. We can turn Twitter <a href="http://www.joinred.com/red/">(RED)</a> for a day, and chalk it up to raising awareness. But such efforts ring hollow to people in need, unaware of our good intentions, and unaffected by inaction.</p>
<p>Social media for social change does make sense to me. It makes sense as a facilitator of ideas. Whether or not it can facilitate more is yet to be seen. Until then, Twitter will remain an important part of my professional arsenal, and the Facebook movie will hands down remain my favorite film of 2010.</p>

<p>The gang studied by Venkatesh has a more symbiotic relationship with the wider community than one might assume. For a community which is starved of outside investment the gang plays a dual role of public predator and social benefactor. The gang is active in local philanthropy, donating significant sums of money to non-profits who are otherwise left to raise funds from an impoverished donor base.</p>
<p>A gang that is active in donating to churches and Boys and Girls Clubs might seem perplexing, but I would argue it is no more jarring than the corporate double speak of British Petroleum's engagement with several environmental organizations in the lead up to the worst oil spill in history. A piece in the Economist early last month rightly <a title="pointed out" href="http://www.economist.com/businessfinance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16274145">pointed out</a> that "the scrutiny of these ties to BP is intensifying the perennial debate about how long a spoon NGOs should use when supping with corporate devils."</p>
<p>The Economist goes on to quote Walter Massey, the chair of McDonald's corporate social responsibility program, who</p>
<blockquote><p>...has also been on the board of BP, which he believes benefited from its work with NGOs after a deadly accident at a refinery in Texas in 2002. “The company’s reservoir of goodwill, built up over years of committed corporate stewardship, was of critical aid in helping us to weather the storm,” he said in March. The latest crisis suggests that the reservoir is not bottomless, however.</p></blockquote>
<p>Setting aside our prejudice against street gangs, on face, one might argue that although gangs terrorize the communities they are in, their philanthropic pursuits might exonerate them as socially responsible. Of course, a socially responsible street gang is oxymoronic, or perhaps just plainly moronic. While a gang might be responsible for propping up youth and anti-gang violence non-profit organizations in a poor area, it is the gang that creates the social harms the non-profits are intended to combat. It is the equivalent of a virus donating to a hospital, or Pepsi promoting healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p>Years ago the federal government cracked down on tobacco agencies incessant advertising of chronic smokers as fit, healthy people. The government was right to intercede. Carcinogens cause cancer. Excess amounts of sugar causes diabetes. And leaking oil in the ocean destroys eco-systems.</p>
<p>Whereas unethical corporations once worked solely with savvy marketing executives to manipulate public opinion regarding the harms their goods cause, today those same corporations turn to non-profit organizations who have their hands out and eyes closed, all too eager to blanket the sins of business thugs in the Trojan Horse of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>I am not arguing that non-profit organizations should not have relationships with corporations. However, we need to be clear headed about such partnerships, recognizing not only what is to be gained for our own organizations, but what the potential costs are, and where our corporate partners' true ambitions lie. The short-term capital infusions of ill-conceived partnerships are not worth the longer-term harm to our sector's reputation and the causes we care deeply about.</p>
<p>Like street gangs that use philanthropic donations to make communities reliant on their continuance and therefore tolerant of their deviance, corporate social responsibility, in the absence of actual responsibility, is nothing more than a cynical marketing gimmick better understood as socially responsible thuggery.</p>

        <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-270" href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/?attachment_id=270"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-270" src="/assets/images/measure-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="165" /></a>Yesterday Sean Stannard-Stockton put up an excellent post titled <a href="http://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2010/06/outputs-outcomes-impact-oh-my">Getting Results: Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact</a> explaining the difference between outputs, outcomes, and impact. Looking at each type of indicator separately, Sean writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Outputs</strong>: These are the activities done by the nonprofit. The meals served by a soup kitchen are outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: These are the observed effects of the outputs on the beneficiaries of the nonprofit. The degree to which the meals served by the soup kitchen reduce hunger in the population served by the soup kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: This is the degree to which the outcomes observed by a nonprofit are attributable to its activities. The impact of the soup kitchen is the degree to which a reduction of hunger in the population they serve is attributable to its efforts. While a soup kitchen might serve a lot of meals and correctly observe that hunger is subsequently less prevalent in the population it serves, the reduction in hunger might simply be attributable to an improving economy, or a new school lunch program or some other activities that are not part of the soup kitchen’s efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sean’s post made me realize that when I write about outcomes on this blog I am actually referring to impact. By conflating outcomes with impact I hope that I have not been misleading in the past, and I appreciate Sean’s clarification on the terminology. In his piece, Sean went on to argue that outputs are inferior to outcomes as units of measurement, with impact being the gold standard objective. I certainly agree with this final point that impact, the change created as a result of a particular intervention, is the sole, truly meaningful metric.</p>
<p>However, I was more iffy on the assertion that outcomes, as defined by Sean, are clearly superior to outputs. In the comment section on the Tactical Philanthropy blog, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Outputs and impact are more pure metrics in that they both isolate an effect of the intervention. The output obviously tells us very little (such as in your example a client receiving food aid) and the impact telling us a lot (the degree to which hunger decreased, nutrition increased, etc., as a result of that aid). While it might seem that outcomes are superior to outputs, there is serious risk that outcomes are misleading, as you get to a bit.</p>
<p>Most damaging, the outcomes metric can mask harms from an output. You allude to a scenario where there are multiple factors at play toward a positive end of an intervention, but an intervention can actually have a negative effect, which might be offset by other environmental factors, not only masking the harm of the intervention but wrapping it in a cloak of success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sean responded to my comment by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>David,</p>
<p>I would argue that Outcomes are objectively more important (better) than Outputs, but admit freely that they are harder to measure. I guess like any powerful tool, they can become dangerous if used incorrectly (miscalculated).</p></blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, I believe I overstated my point when I suggested that outcomes are not more telling than outputs. Sean was right to hold his ground. However, I am still troubled by a hierarchical mental framework that holds outcomes over outputs, when outcomes are inherently riddled with extraneous factors outside the control of a particular intervention.</p>
<p>An output does not say anything about a change in a service recipient’s life, therefore making it an indicator of little use for assessing social value of an intervention. However, an output is a pure metric in that the output is clearly the result of the organization administering the intervention. In this way, although an output does not say anything about what happened in an individual’s life, it accurately indicates what a particular agency did.</p>
<p>This may seem like a non-point, but let’s look at the clarity of the output metric versus an outcomes metric. An outcome is a ratio in which the numerator is impacted by any number of variables which are not controlled for. For example, we can look at the change in hunger levels amongst a population that accesses a food pantry. One might find that incidences of hunger have gone down amongst that population over a period of time. In this sense, there is a positive outcome indicator (lower incidences of hunger) which might correlate with a higher level of food distribution by the food pantry.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that the lower incidences of hunger could be the result of any number of factors, like lower food prices, better wages, etc. Worse yet, what if the food pantry’s activities actually had a negative impact on food insecurity, or produced some other harms? Outcomes is a metric that risks both masking the negative effect of an intervention and crediting an intervention with factors outside the control of said intervention. This effect works the other way too, a population might do worse over time in a particular indicator due to forces outside the control of that intervention, even though the intervention might have a hidden, positive causal effect. In this way, a focus on outcomes might create incentives for service providers to focus on populations that will do better in certain indicators despite their interventions, thus achieving an outcomes windfall.</p>
<p>My point here is not to continue a debate about whether outcomes or outputs are better metrics. I agree with Sean and the others who blasted my comment, a focus on outcomes is more meaningful than outputs. I think my objection is more rooted in the fear that one might believe that if one has outcomes data, than output data is not relevant. In the absence of impact, both metrics are important. Outputs tell us what a service provider did, outcomes tell us what happened to service recipients over a period of time.</p>
<p>Of course, this debate would be rendered moot if we were better able to assess impact. As many have pointed out though the social sector struggles to reliably collect output or outcomes data, let alone make any serious attempt at impact analysis. While I concede that outcomes are a more important metric than outputs, I believe the path forward is through fostering an appreciation and deep understanding of what specific indicators can, and cannot, tell us about the work we do. Ultimately, we need to collect a number of indicators. More importantly, we need to know what these indicators are actually telling us, and the various ways in which our indicators, especially composite indicators that are impacted by a large number of variables, actually mean.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teknokool/3729453412/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-220" src="/assets/images/too-big-to-fail-by-jeffisageek-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>The collapse of the U.S. economy, and subsequent bailout of the financial sector has brought the phrase "too big to fail" into the collective social conscience. The argument goes that the economy should not be so dependent on any one company that without it, everything falls apart. It seems fairly clear in hindsight why making a handful of profit seeking financial institutions socially indispensable was a bad idea.</p>
<p>I wonder however if the same logic doesn't extend to the social sector. I work with non-profits big and small, all who claim they offer critical services. They make these claims to solicit donations, but in the aftermath of Too Big to Fail, the idea that certain social sector institutions are absolutely essential might be more unsettling than moving.</p>
<p>In the social sector we defend agencies' rights to create monopolies, veiled in an avoidance of <em>duplication of services</em>. Social sector agencies argue that there are limited funds to produce social value with. Therefore, in order to maximize social output we should avoid situations where one agency's service offering overlaps with another. The result is regional monopolies whereby a few organizations are granted full control over a range of social services, thus manufacturing an environment where agencies can claim to be critical backbones of the social sector.</p>
<p>Their claims of being too big, too critical to society, to fail, are legitimated by the dogmatic adherence to avoiding duplication of services. All the praise heaped on these organizations amazingly echoes the same complaints we now have about unwieldy financial institutions. Anti-competitive social sector collusion is the backdrop for the social sector version of Too Big to Fail.</p>
<p>The idea of social sector organizations being too big to fail is even more disturbing considering we don't have much reason to believe they are effective, even though their entire hegemonic reign is predicated on the assumption of maximum social impact.</p>
<p>Organizations that successfully convince the public they provide essential services might very well be producing more marketing miracles than Hallmark moments. In fact, I have serious doubts about most organizations' capacities to measure changes in client indicators period, let alone asses the extent to which those changes are the result of program activities.</p>
<p>I recently read a report about program measurement released by the Gates Foundation titled <a title="A Guide to Actionable Measurement" href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/learning/Pages/a-guide-to-actionable-measurement.aspx">A Guide to Actionable Measurement</a> (non-profit consultant Gayle Gifford has a nice <a title="write up" href="http://www.ceffect.com/blog/effectiveness/measuring-impact-like-the-gates/">write up</a> about the report on her blog). While the report provides a comprehensive evaluation strategy, I was struck by the simple advice the report offers to not always focus on measuring social impact by relating program outputs to client outcomes.</p>
<p>I often drink the social outcomes measurement Koolaid, but this Gates report got me thinking that  simply understanding whether clients who receive a particular service are better off or not is a logical evaluative starting point. However, the extent of our evaluation woes is so deep that even such a simple, summary data type assessment of client indicators is more elusive than it ought to be, a problem that is compounded by a social sector culture that favors non-profit monopolies.</p>
<p>Through monopolization a handful of organizations, rightly or wrongly, are allowed to claim credit for a community's status quo. The anti-competitive nature of the social sector creates an atmosphere whereby every organization can claim that reduced funding or closure of their programs will lead to social disarray.</p>
<p>I view the problems of anti-competitiveness and poor evaluation in the social sector to be linked. Anti-competitiveness, and adherence to avoiding duplication of services, supersedes the need for serious evaluation. Evaluation is not only a tool for evaluating client progress, it is a lens through which comparison between interventions, and agencies, can be drawn.</p>
<p>So long as the social sector continues to espouse anti-competitiveness cloaked in the flag of collaboration, we will continue to have a sector that is not necessarily too big to fail, but is certainly too small-minded to succeed.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29233640@N07/3645211083/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-201" src="/assets/images/angrymob-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></a>Few topics in the social sector are as ludicrous as the allegedly excessive compensation of non-profit executives. Not only is it a comical thought that anyone truly wanting to enrich themselves would go into the <em>poverty</em> business, it is painfully beside the point.</p>
<p>The debate over nonprofit executive compensation has little to do with increasing social impact. Rather, such arguments underscore the antiquated view still held by some that charity is about personal sacrifice rather than public benefit. Moreover, the controversy surrounding appropriate levels of executive compensation cannot be satisfactorily resolved until we establish metrics that allow us to meaningfully measure executive output against the only standard that matters, social outcomes.</p>
<p>Until recently, charity has been almost exclusively viewed as a personal sacrafice, a gift to the public realized as an economic loss rather than an investment in the greater good. In this misconcieving of charity, charity workers themselves are also assumed to be in the social sector with an expectation of personal sacrifice, generally viewed as paid volunteers rather than seasoned, well trained professionals.</p>
<p>Charity as sacrifice is a deprecated concept for a reason, it is a model that yields no discernible social impact. In the new era of social investing, and <a title="professional social entrepreneurs" href="http://www.fullcontactphilanthropy.com/2010/04/professional-social-entrepreneur/">professional social entrepreneurs</a>, working in the social sector is not about self-sacrifice, it is about professionalizing and innovating on the ways we help hurting people.</p>
<p>Debating executive compensation, in and of itself, is a pointless exercise. Compensation in any sector should be commensurate with performance. The problem is that as a sector we lack any real ability to measure social progress. So long as we fail to measure social outcomes, we will lack the sole, bottom-line metric we need to evaluate executive compensation.</p>
<p>Outrage over executive compensation is simply an extension of the same line of illogic used in evaluating charities by their <a title="overhead ratios" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2009/12/charity-navigator-fixes-its-compass.html">overhead ratios</a> (in fact, executive compensation is an overhead expense). Like overhead ratios, the brouhaha over executive compensation in the social sector underscores our inability to measure social progress, recently illustrated in a post on the Chronicle of Philanthropy by non-profit consultant Rosetta Thurman.</p>
<p>Rosetta, commenting on a recent <a title="controversy" href="http://philanthropy.com/article/Senators-Call-On-Boys-Girls/64665/">controversy</a> over the total annual compensation package of the Boys and Girls Club Chief Executive Officer (about $900,000) <a title="writes" href="http://philanthropy.com/blogPost/Nonprofit-CEOs-Who-Want/21792/">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I absolutely believe that nonprofit CEO's should earn good pay. But there's a big difference between good pay and excessive pay. While an organization can use any number of formulas to set compensation, it's clear that many a reasonable person would deem Ms. Spillett's salary excessive. I'm certainly not saying that nonprofit CEO's should take a vow of poverty but that it may be problematic to have leaders in our sector who could be deemed "rich."</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if we sent the message to the general public that helping poor people as a career choice was not only morally righteous, but economically rewarding, where <em>would </em>we be? Perhaps we would have attracted the talent we need to establish proper outcomes metrics so we would not feel the need to assess executive compensation packages by the same standard the Supreme Court uses to <a title="differentiate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">differentiate</a> art from porn.</p>
<p>Executive compensation should be based on social outcomes. Just as for-profit executives are evaluated on their performance relative to profits, and are compensated accordingly, so too should we in the social sector reward our executives based on their creation of social profit.</p>
<p>Until we establish better social outcomes metrics, and mechanisms for regularly, and rigorously, evaluating organizational output, we cannot have an honest discussion about executive compensation.</p>
