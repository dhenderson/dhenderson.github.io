While making predictions is no easy task, <a href="http://www.sylviabrowne.com/">not even for psychics</a>, making predictions in the social sector is especially difficult.</p>
<p>Most industries tend to have clear industry leaders. These organizations, like Apple, Chevron, and Wallmart are significantly large that they can in many ways move industries on account of their sheer size. In the social sector we have no clear market makers, with the exception of governments. But governments are inherently unpredictable. Democracies are subject to deadlock, compromise, and regular leadership change. Dictatorships, while marked by leadership consistency, lend themselves to rulers with unpredictable and often erratic behavior and management decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, a common metric used for industry predictions is consumer demand. While a company like Amazon can use its vast consumer behavior database and market research to predict the directional winds of what consumers want, addressing needs is a significantly different undertaking. The demand we address tends to be either immediate (homelessness, hunger) or arguably intractable (systematic poverty).</p>
<p>Aggregate social indicators like poverty and unemployment rates are the most popular indicators used for predicting future demand. Yet the reliability of these predictors is questionable considering the regularity of reports about how organizations are blindsided by demand for their services. Indeed, these social predictors are highly imperfect, especially considering our inability to agree on a <a href="http://www.povertyinsights.org/2011/06/17/la-homeless-count-finds-homelessness-either-increasing-or-decreasing/">definition of poverty in the United States</a> and the persistently misleading reports of <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/povmeas/methodology/supplemental/research/Short_ResearchSPM2010.pdf">homeless counts</a>.</p>
<p>While big-data is being put to lucrative use in some sectors, especially technology, the most accurate predictions are based on the aggregation of front-line organizations’ own data. Big-data is itself by definition aggregations of micro-consumer behavior and transactions. The difficulty we face in applying these same tactics in the social sector however is that in order to aggregate meaningful large-scale data-sets, <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/10/20/focus-on-big-data-misses-the-big-picture/">we must first collect and analyze meaningful micro-sets</a>.</p>
<p>To this end, my company is working with organizations helping them setup data collection pipelines and analytic processes so they can better make predictions of both demand and impact. Making increasingly more accurate organizational level predictions is a necessary first step to reliable industry wide predictions.</p>
<p>Despite all the blog posts, books, and questionable models to the contrary, we are a long ways away from being able to predict with any relevance the future of the social sector. Therefore, the only prediction I will make for 2012 is that the future is unclear.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p><a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/12/21/data-is-not-information/whatyouaredoing-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-669"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-669" title="whatyouaredoing" src="/assets/images/whatyouaredoing1-250x199.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="199" /></a>For all the buzz about how data is supposed to change the social sector, there is scant evidence that revolution is truly underway. Certainly there are high-profit efforts to catalogue and aggregate data as social sector organizations are savvy to the importance of documenting their work and outcomes in databases. But moving data from our heads to paper to the cloud does not necessarily create value, much less social change.</p>
<p>A recent article in GOOD asks <a href="http://www.good.is/post/is-solving-nonprofits-challenges-as-easy-as-creating-a-map/">"is solving nonprofits' challenges as easy as creating maps?".</a> One of my company's areas of focus is <a href="http://idealistics.org/methods/technology/community-resources/">mapping social services in communities</a>, helping service seekers connect to programs and helping organizations better understand their geographies. Therefore, as someone who knows a thing or two about mapping in the non-profit sector, I thought I would take a crack at answering this question.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Databases and maps store data. But data is not information. Data becomes information when used to inform decision making. Numbers, regressions, and longitudes and latitudes do not impute meaning. How we use, contextualize, and interpret data determines informational value, not the size of a database nor the contours on a map.</p>
<p>Despite this rather obvious point, our efforts and interests are stuck on this most primitive definition of data. Government and non-profit organizations spend considerable money on database systems to store and collect data without clear strategies for how they will use it. In this way, the social sector suffers the dual cost of both the cash outlay spent on aimless data collection, and the more insidious invisible opportunity cost of what might have been had these organizations successfully converted their data to information.</p>
<p>Indeed, the CTO of Infochimps, a company at the forefront of the big data revolution, smartly argues that <a href="http://blog.infochimps.com/2011/12/16/big-data-predictions-for-2012-part-one/">storing data is not only a significant pain, but of no real value</a>. Instead what matters is insight.</p>
<p>Data on its own provides no insight, <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/10/20/focus-on-big-data-misses-the-big-picture/">not even big data</a>. Before an organization thinks about collecting data, I first ask what decisions they are trying to inform. The questions an organization is trying to answer drives sound data collection efforts, as these questions provide the necessary context to inform future decision making.</p>
<p>The social sector would do well to focus less on buzz words like open-data, big data, mapping, info-graphics, and any other form of trivial data distractions that masks the real problems our sector exists to address every day.</p>
<p>The data revolution can, and should, be a boon for our sector and those we serve. Databases are cheap and public datasets are copious. Free tools like Google Earth and <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> afford anyone with the necessary patience to develop real analytic competence the opportunity to do so, and better the lives of those in need. And while there are efforts like <a href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> that underscore the power of marrying technical know-how with social problems, too much of our public discourse is dominated by proponents of the most trivial data artifacts.</p>
<p>Hurting people could care less about slick info-graphics or mapping their descent into homelessness in "real-time". Our job is to solve social problems. If our data doesn't help us help people better, it's not information, it's just noise.</p>

        <p><a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/10/24/possibilities-and-probabilities-of-social-impact-bonds/wall_street__1987/" rel="attachment wp-att-641"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-641" title="wall_street__1987" src="/assets/images/wall_street__1987-250x195.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="195" /></a>Last Friday the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Partnership hosted a <a href="http://philanthropy.com/blogs/government-and-politics/white-house-event-on-nonprofit-finance-to-be-streamed-live/29516">one day seminar</a> on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/paying-for-success">pay-for success</a> (also known as social impact bond) approach to social sector financing. I’ve been <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/04/04/social-impact-bonds-will-fail-without-solving-the-evaluation-problem-first/">critical of social impact bonds (SIB) in the past</a>, so was interested to watch the White House’s live stream of the event.</p>
<p>The promise of social impact bonds is to provide a new way of financing <em>some</em> social interventions. Panelists at the White House summit were quick to acknowledge that SIBs are not a cure all approach, and that not all interventions are well suited for this type of funding.</p>
<p>My criticism of SIBs in the past has been that the investment approach assumes evaluations can be performed reliably. Obviously, <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2010/11/11/focus-on-scaling-evaluations-is-premature/">I think evaluation is a pretty thorny</a> issue that we have a long ways to go on. I was happy to see that proponents of SIBs at this event were aware of this problem, and while more optimistic about which programs are easily measured than I am, realized there were limitations.</p>
<p>The example that has been most used in peddling SIBs, and the only actual implantation of the concept I’m aware of, involves an anti-recidivism program in a UK prison. Prisons provide a nice opportunity for evaluators because you can easily collect longitudinal data (prisoners and parolees are already monitored) and you have a logical control group (neighboring prisons).</p>
<p>Other social interventions don’t provide such fertile ground for experimentation. Yet ascertaining the effectiveness of a program is at the heart of the agreement between an investor and the government, which backs the bond.</p>
<p>Indeed, as was discussed at the seminar, the critical negotiation in a SIB is when the investor and government establish the ground-rules for when the government pays out, and when it doesn’t. The investor has an incentive for weaker evidence of success while the government prefers stronger.</p>
<p>While the SIB discussion centers on thresholds like the number of positive outcomes, the discussion got me thinking about another metric of success, the <em>probability</em> that an intervention actually caused a desired outcome.</p>
<p>For example, an employment program might place a hundred people in jobs in a month, but would those people have found jobs anyway? This is the question a control group helps inform. But the control group does not answer this question definitively. Instead the best evidence one can get is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>A program exceeds its outcomes threshold</li>
<li>There is a certain probability that the program deserves credit for this success</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the question is not just about achieving an outcome objective, but how sure we are that the relationship between the intervention and outcome is not due to random chance. Achieving a high significance threshold further limits the possibilities of SIBs, as in order to ensure fairness to both the bond holders and backers, ample data in a controlled environment is a necessity.</p>
<p>The White House seminar, as well as discussions I’ve had since my last post on this topic, softened my stance on social impact bonds. As <a href="http://www.socialfinanceus.org/about/staff/tracy-palandjian">Tracy Palandjian</a>, CEO of <a href="http://www.socialfinanceus.org/">Social Finance</a> smartly said, social impact bonds are about managing “execution risk”. Where there are opportunities for well controlled experiments, like prisons, SIBs might very well help governments manage that risk.</p>
<p>What SIBs won’t do is drive innovation, nor will they replace all existing forms of social funding. But they don’t need to in order to be a success. If SIBs can help governments improve the performance and financing of a subset of their social investment portfolios, that’d be a significant accomplishment anyone would have a hard time questioning.</p>

Social sector talking heads are preaching the promise of "big data", yet few arguments have been made about how all this data will facilitate impact.</p>
<p>Data is useful only in so far as it helps inform decision making. And while social sector organizations aim to solve big problems, their solutions are decidedly smaller in scale and scope.</p>
<p>Indeed, an organization developing a job training program might look at macroeconomic conditions to determine the total potential market size for an intervention. But unless that intervention covers a large enough geography to significantly influence over all employment (which is rarely the case) the more useful information is the micro, "small data" that an agency collects itself.</p>
<p>I think about so-called big data, like Census indicators, as providing the context for an intervention. It's the market data that develops the case for action. But once that decision to act is in place, there's little left for big contextual data to inform.</p>
<p>The more pressing questions, like is this program working and how do I increase impact, cannot be answered by large public databases. Instead the focus needs to be on developing analytical capacity and program specific data collection feedback loops that capture relevant indicators on an iterative basis.</p>
<p>Yet our current obsession with big data and trivial infographics obscures the real promise of an analytically oriented social sector for soundbites and graph porn.</p>
<p>If we want to tackle the big problems, we need organizations to be able to collect and analyze small data sets relevant to their own work. Our wrongheaded focus on large scale data for the sake of seeming analytical obfuscates the real opportunities data affords.</p>

But as the <a href="http://www.endhomelessness.org/section/solutions/ten_year_plan">10 Year Plan to End Homelessness</a> illustrates, most of the predictions we make in the social sector are based on hope and little else.</p>
<p>Good predictions are based on sound models and historical data. And before you think the concept of modeling is too technical or outside the realm of the social sector, I would argue that every organization has a model. It's called a theory of change.</p>
<p>Publicly traded companies make revenue predictions that investors analyze to determine whether to buy, hold, or dump stock. Social sector agencies are similarly asked to make predictions about what changes they are going to create in the world and how they are going to do it.</p>
<p>Companies have a lot to lose when they fail to meet projected targets. Analysts rip companies apart and investors lose confidence not only in companies' predictive abilities, but in management and future viability as well.</p>
<p>But in the social sector we are rarely evaluated based on our predictions. As a result we shoot for the moon, hit the dirt, and call it a success. And while all this unreasonable ambition sounds good, and makes for catchy campaign titles, does it help us advance public welfare?</p>
<p>Our outlandishly high expectations and horribly unfounded predictions undermine donors' faith in our ability to create real social change. Indeed, it's seems an unspoken truth of the social sector is that if your theory of change doesn't draw a straight line between your local intervention and world peace, then you're just not doing it right.</p>
<p>What's wrong with setting reasonable objectives? Why not have a theory of change that relates what you do to what you can actually accomplish; instead of relating what you do to some fantastical notion of what you wish might happen?</p>
<p>Instead of spinning increasingly more ludicrous stories, we'd be better served aiming lower and actually hitting our targets. That way we could accurately account for what we do, measure our impact, and iterate on our interventions.</p>
<p>The byproduct of reasoned predictions based on realistic theories of change would be something far better than stories that make donor's hearts swell. We'd have stories people could actually believe.</p>
