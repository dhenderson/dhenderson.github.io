        <p>Transparency is generally thought to be one of the core values of the social sector. Executives and non-profit consultants go to great length to ensure agencies remain transparent.</p>
<p>Despite our obsession with transparency (some may argue because of it), <a href="http://philanthropy.com/article/Nonprofit-Fraud-Isn-t/127268/">nonprofit fraud is not widespread</a>. One would of course hope that the social sector exists for more than just to <em>not</em> commit fraud. Are our standards really so low that a day free of governance maleficence is a day well spent?</p>
<p>Of course not. The social sector exists to create social value. That's what donors expect of us, and that is what most of us expect from ourselves.</p>
<p>Charity watchdogs like Guidestar have begun moving beyond financial and governance issues, <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/rxa/news/articles/2009/the-state-of-nonprofit-transparency-2008.aspx">encouraging organizations to post evidence of impact on their websites</a>. While the for-profit technology startup scene <a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/11/28/fail-fast-how-startups-can-learn-from-their-mistakes/">advocates the importance of "failing fast"</a> in order to test ideas and iterate quickly to achieve effective offerings, the social sector seems petrified by the prospect of evaluation, lest an evaluative inquiry discover that an organization has failed to single handedly eradicate global poverty.</p>
<p>And yet without feedback, no program, for-profit or non-profit, can improve. Savvy donors understand that. In the new era of impact investing donors are more persuaded by an organization they believe has an <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/06/26/your-donors-are-not-stupid/">honest approach</a> more than an agency with a fantastical story.</p>
<p>My work centers on helping organizations improve program impact by learning from their evaluative metrics. I got into this business to help organizations help people better, but a natural consequence of better outcomes is strong fundraising prowess as well.</p>
<p>As the donor mindset shifts to that of the impact investor, I have begun to encourage the organizations I work with to learn (and fail) out loud. While many organizations have "impact" pages on their websites, the content of those pages tend to be a story of one amazing case or an enumeration of a select subset of program outputs. These pages tend to not be terribly informative, nor believable to the savvy donor.</p>
<p>But despite the plethora of shadowy claims of exceptional, unsubstantiated claims of impact on organizations' websites, these same organizations will consider it a sign of organizational integrity to publicly post their third-party audited financial statements.</p>
<p>So, we consider it a value to publicly post our financials but not our impact? Frankly, I'm more interested in the results an organization produces than how it spends its money. Most donors are.</p>
<p>To help our clients better communicate their results (and more importantly their institutional learning) we developed a system that allows organizations to publicly share the reports we produce on their websites.</p>
<p>Just as there is value in hiring a third party auditor to examine an organization's financial data, we believe the same is true for evaluative metrics. The public has grown to expect audited financial statements from non-profits. Audited impact statements are the logical next step if transparency is truly valuable to the social sector. Indeed, rrom a donor perspective, impact transparency might be the only kind of transparency that matters at all.</p>

        <p>My primary focus is helping organization's improve their programs based on outcomes metric, but there is no doubt that fundraising and development are on the minds of every agency executive that I work with. I used to shy away from this fact, but I now embrace the desire of agency executives to use evaluative data for fundraising purposes as an opportunity to bring truth in advertising, a particularly exciting prospect as <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/06/26/your-donors-are-not-stupid/">donors become increasingly savvier investors</a>.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that there are plenty of organizations (and people) that overplay their contributions to the public good. But there are also organizations that unwittingly mask their outcomes in poorly defined metrics, framing their social value to donors in ways that are at odds with their own internal organizational decision calculus.</p>
<p>A large affordable housing development and homeless service providing organization I work with is a great illustration of how our choice of outcomes metrics can obscure the real value an organization aims to optimize over.</p>
<p>As is typical in homeless services, this organization reports, among other things, the number of people housed annually. The problem with this metric is that it values housing a mentally ill chronically homeless person who has been on the streets for 19 years the same as housing someone who slipped into homelessness for one month due to momentary economic shocks, like job loss.</p>
<p>Assuming the number of people housed is actually what this organization wanted to maximize, the rational thing to do would be to move away from chronic homelessness and only house those whose homeless spells is likely to be very short. But this is not how the organization actually thinks, or how it makes program decisions.</p>
<p>This agency, again like many homeless service providers, cares deeply about those experiencing the continuum of homelessness, especially those who are chronically homeless. In economic terms, the organization derives more utility, or value, from housing a more difficult to house individual than from a less difficult to house person.</p>
<p>The trick then is to first internally formalize the organization's utility framework, and then to identify the outcomes metrics the organization is actually optimizing over. For example, instead of the number of people housed, a more meaningful metric might be the number of years of homeless prevented, or the <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/06/21/minimizing-years-of-life-lost-due-to-homelessness/">number of years of life preserved that likely would have otherwise been lost</a>. Not only are these metrics better representative of how the organization plans its interventions, it also paints a more complete picture for potential donors.</p>
<p>In cases like this, I embrace the fundraising and development aspirations of the organizations I work with to the extent that helping them better understand their data will actually move them closer (rather than further) from articulating a truer story of the social benefit their agency contributes toward.</p>

        <p>Anyone familiar with the concept of an outlier is fairly well inoculated from the seductive aroma of a well penned anecdote. Yet fundraising consultants continue to peddle the tired myth of the winning story, the singular parable that will endow an agency into perpetuity.</p>
<p>We are in the era of savvy donors. While I applaud the sector's recognition of the importance of outcomes measurement, I'm afraid we are overemphasizing the importance of big numbers versus good measurement practices.</p>
<p>When I was in college I ran a small non-profit that was surprisingly competitive in grant applications. We did not necessarily have a greater impact than those organizations we competed for funding against (quite the contrary in fact). Although we did not have <em>bigger </em>numbers than other organizations, we did have better processes and capacity to collect and learn from our data.</p>
<p>Other organizations provided bigger numbers, we provided more believable ones.</p>
<p>The pressure to report big numbers is more self-imposed than we tend to realize. Foundations and donors are begging organizations not for more fantastically large metrics, but something they have good reason to believe is true, within some well estimated margin of error.</p>
<p>As donors become more sophisticated in their giving, increasingly more agnostic across focus areas, organizations must also become more sophisticated in their internal use of information and more statistically honest in their reporting.</p>
<p>Anyone can make up a big number. 5,439! See, that was easy. But it doesn't mean anything. If you know it, so do your donors.</p>
<p>Indeed, the brilliance of the dawn of the impact oriented social investor is that organizations would do well to fully embrace evidence based processes for the betterment of program impact <em>and </em>the assurance of future funding.</p>
<p>But having data is not enough, and blindly reporting metrics or wrongly inferring meaning from misleading infographics is plainly transparent to this new crop of social investors. To win their hearts, organizations must win these donors' minds. And in their minds, they are investors, no longer emotionally manipulatable donors.</p>

      <article class="post-content">
        <p>Housing First, the approach to chronic homelessness that places people into supportive housing instead of treating them on the streets, has been largely adopted by homeless advocates due to its measurable cost savings. Numerous studies have found that the cost of placing chronically homeless persons in supportive housing is lower than the cost of servicing them on the street.</p>
<p>Housing First’s detractors argue investment in Housing First is crowding out more traditional interventions like homeless shelters, which serve chronic and non-chronic homeless persons alike.</p>
<p>While the research on Housing First has largely focused on the cost of housing versus not housing the chronically homeless, the larger debate is really about how to best allocate the total sum of dollars available for homeless services, chronic and non-chronic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any social investment is about maximizing or minimizing an outcome given a set of constraints. While cost has largely driven the Housing First rhetoric, another way to think about homeless interventions is to minimize the decrease in life expectancy an individual experiences due to homelessness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pathwaystohousing.org/files/AnnualReport_2007.pdf">According to Pathways to Housing</a>, chronic homelessness decreases life expectancy by an average of 25 years. Given this assumption, I wondered what the equivalent number of years of life lost for a non-chronic homeless person would need to be indifferent between investing in chronic versus non-chronic homelessness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.endhomelessness.org/content/article/detail/4361">In 2011, the estimated national homeless population</a> on a given night was 636,017 people, with 107,148 chronically homeless and 528,869 not chronically homeless. To setup my indifference model, I assumed that the chronically homeless population was a closed population, that is, the same 107,148 people stayed homeless for the year (a knowingly incorrect approximation).</p>
<p>Calculating the number of non-chronically homeless persons is more complicated, the annualized number of non-chronically homeless persons is a function of the average duration of non-chronically homeless persons’ homeless spells (measured in months spent homeless in my model). Mathematically, the approximation of the annual number of unique non-chronically homeless persons is the point in time count divided by the fraction of the year spent homeless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/06/21/minimizing-years-of-life-lost-due-to-homelessness/non-chronic_pop/" rel="attachment wp-att-860"><img class="size-full wp-image-860 aligncenter" title="non-chronic_pop" src="/assets/images/non-chronic_pop.png" alt="" width="359" height="62" /></a></p>
<p>To get the point of indifference between investing in chronic versus non-chronic homelessness, assuming all we care about is minimizing the total number of years of life lost, we need to find the point where the sum of all years of life lost for chronically homeless persons is equal to the sum of all years lost for non-chronic homeless persons.</p>
<p>The following chart shows the average number of years a non-chronically homeless person would have to lose on account of their homelessness based on the number of months in the year spent homeless. Assuming a twelve-month average duration of homelessness, non-chronic homelessness would have to take an average of five years off of non-chronically homeless persons' life expectancies to equal the twenty-five years average loss of life for non-chronically homeless persons.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2012/06/21/minimizing-years-of-life-lost-due-to-homelessness/yrs_lost_non_chronic_hl/" rel="attachment wp-att-864"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864" title="yrs_lost_non_chronic_hl" src="/assets/images/yrs_lost_non_chronic_hl-e1340285260122.png" alt="" width="510" height="394" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The above calculations make a lot of assumptions, and are better understood as approximations rather than concrete guidelines. Furthermore, the model assumes that we value the total number of lives lost equally, that is, that twenty-five years of life lost for one person is equivalent to one year of life lost for twenty-five people, which might not be how you actually think about the value of life.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the average duration of non-chronic homelessness is, so I can’t necessarily weigh in on whether this model would suggest a change in the current investment mix in homeless services. Regardless, if the social sector is to be more strategic with its investments, we would do well to carefully consider what outcomes were are maximizing or minimizing over. While the cost savings of Housing First are encouraging, I would hope that our objective has more to do with minimizing harm to humans than to our coffers.</p>

        <p>Evaluation and fundraising are two very different worlds. There is a dangerous trend in the social sector to conflate evaluation with fundraising. To be very clear, the skillsets and objectives of an evaluator are different than those of a grant writer and fundraiser, as well they should be.</p>
<p>I care a lot about improving evaluation, and data literacy, in the social sector. It is the only way we will be able to move beyond our current level of collective impact (whatever that level is). As a firm that specializes in helping organizations learn from their evaluative metrics, I often struggle with the best way to position our work.</p>
<p>On the one hand, our customers are significantly more competitive in grant applications because they have a better approach to understanding their outcomes, and improving programming accordingly, than other agencies. But while our customers enjoy a competitive advantage in grant applications, my partner and I have always resisted the urge to encourage organizations to work with us to improve their financial bottom lines.</p>
<p>The reason we have resisted drawing a relationship between fundraising and evaluative metrics is because our job is not to help organizations “tell their story” or “prove an organization is a great non-profit”. We try to help our customers learn from the reality of their program impact (or lack thereof), and to improve their programming based on as true an estimate as we can get of the effects of their interventions.</p>
<p>The fact is that funders are desperately looking for any evidence that their dollars are making a difference in the world. That is why our clients are more competitive in grant applications, because they can demonstrate an enhanced capacity to evaluate their outcomes and learn from their mistakes. This is not the same thing as demonstrating that they are awesome, rather, it is signaling that they are capable of identifying where they are awesome, where they are not, and how to improve.</p>
<p>I saw a job posting on Idealist for a director of grants and evaluation. The job description largely entailed focusing on grant opportunities, with the “evaluation” portion solely dedicated to proving program impact. This is absolutely the wrong way to think about evaluation.</p>
<p>I do believe it makes sense for organizations to dedicate some of their grants budget to evaluation, but not to prove program impact. Instead, any organization that can demonstrate an ability to identify program success and failure, and the capacity to learn from those results, will stand out to evidence starved funders.</p>
