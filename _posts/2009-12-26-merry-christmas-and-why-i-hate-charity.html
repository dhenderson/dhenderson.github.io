<p>Christmas is a lot of things to a lot of people. To some it's a reminder of how great they have it and that they should be more giving to those who have less.  Those who have more might have volunteered today, given away a turkey to a needy family, and felt great about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to those who step up during the holidays to improve the lives of others, some people don't care for anyone but themselves (I even dated one of them for a long time). Just because I am grateful to those who give does not mean that I like charity.</p>
<p>In order for there to be a giver, there must be a receiver. For there to be a hero, there must be a victim. Indeed the social service sector is one that exists to help those who are victims of the economy, physical violence, drugs and alcohol, mental illness, etc. I cannot relate to those in my sector who say they love charity.  How can anyone love this? I do what I do because I love people, but I don't love charity.</p>
<p>So there you have it, I am a dedicated social servant who hates charity. Merry Christmas, here's looking forward to a  future where your donations won't be necessary.</p>
