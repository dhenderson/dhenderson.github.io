<p>The following string of messages on Twitter are a good example of what Thanksgiving ought to be all about. &nbsp;These messages all center around Mark Horvath, aka @hardlynormal, who is working in a homeless shelter in Glendale, CA for Thanksgiving day.
<ul>
<li><b>@hardlynormal</b>: EMERGENCY! guest chef flaked so I have shelter w/ 10-15 ppl to feed ASAP! a place in Hollywood does takeout @ $20 prsn. Thoughts? Ideas?</li>
<li><b>@david_henderson</b>: @hardlynormal do you have the raw ingredients and just need a chef, or was the guest chef supposed to bring all that stuff?</li>
<li><b>@hardlynormal</b>: @david_henderson I have nothing - each one brings everything. We have a kitchen. I'm waiting until 1 if they don't show up I'll make it hapn</li>
<li><b>@david_henderson</b>: @hardlynormal I'm fairly handy in a kitchen, let me know if you need extra hands. I can pickup some ingredients too. Call if ya need me.</li>
