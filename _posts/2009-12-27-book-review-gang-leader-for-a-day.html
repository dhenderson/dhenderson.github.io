<p><a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0h0U3MUL.jpg"><img class="alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="/assets/images/51V0h0U3MUL.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="200" border="0" /></a>This review is long overdue as I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gang-Leader-Day-Sociologist-Streets/dp/014311493X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261957338&amp;sr=8-1">Gang Leader for a Day</a> this summer.  I try to read as much as I can, it keeps my thinking about social services fresh and exposes me to new realities and ideas.  Gang Leader for a Day, written by sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh, highlights the living conditions and gang structure of an African American gang in a housing project in Chicago.  Venkatesh accumulated the information for the book over a multi-year <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography">ethnographic</a> study.</p>
<p>The book is a quick, entertaining read, although I was disappointed that Venkatesh, writing for a wider audience, provides little academic analysis. The most useful takeaway from Gang Leader is that the residents of the housing project documented in the study view the gang as a part of the community, and not a solely negative one at that.  The gangs, while clear purveyors of drugs, act as a police presence for a community that has a poor relationship with the formal police force.  The gang also generates a lot of the community's economic activity and actively donates to political causes and celebrated social service organizations.</p>
<p>In no way does Venkatesh come across as a gang sympathizer.  Rather, he is a realist, arguing that gangs play several roles in the community.  While I would recommend Gang Leader to someone looking for a fairly light read, I'm currently reading another Venkatesh book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Off-Books-Underground-Economy-Urban/dp/0674030710/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261957916&amp;sr=8-2">Off the Books - the Underground Economy of the Poor</a> which thus far seems to be a better blend of compelling ethnography and substantive analysis.</p>
