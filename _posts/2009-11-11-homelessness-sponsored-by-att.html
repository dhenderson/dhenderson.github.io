<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WSY9SzuL-tE/SvsSN9jMXcI/AAAAAAAAATc/ot4AbD7nf2U/s1600-h/att.jpg"><img border="0" src="/assets/images/att.jpg" /></a>Last week I attended a homeless walk in Los Angeles.&nbsp; The idea of the walk was to raise funds for organizations that provide homeless services and to raise awareness about homelessness.&nbsp; During the walk I saw groups of people from all sorts of corporations such as Wells Fargo, KPMG, and AT&amp;T.&nbsp; What I didn't see were any homeless people.</p>
<p>I get that corporate donations are really just marketing opportunities.&nbsp; I'm not naive to the quid pro quo, nor do I fault any non-profit organizations raising funds for playing ball to get the funds they need.&nbsp; But I couldn't help but be struck, in a bad way, by a group of AT&amp;T employees marching in front of me with big, bright orange company t-shirts. </p>
<p>I don't watch TV, I don't even have cable.&nbsp; All the shows I watch are on <a href="http://hulu.com/">Hulu</a>.&nbsp; Before any show begins a message comes up stating "This show is sponsored by" such and such a company.&nbsp; In America, we're good at commodifying anything and everything.&nbsp; Indeed last weekend, homelessness was sponsored by AT&amp;T.</p>
