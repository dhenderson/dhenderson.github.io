<p>She asked some interesting questions about what comprises good evaluation, how to make evaluation accessible and affordable for organizations of all sizes, and what role government plays in social sector innovation and combating poverty.</p>
<p>The common thread throughout the interview is that the focus of evaluation needs to transition from a grading system used by would-be donors to a tool that helps organizations increase social outcomes.
