<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/2840135917_059f5f290e.jpg"><img border="0" height="150" src="/assets/images/2840135917_059f5f290e.jpg" width="200" /></a>I think about class standing a lot.&nbsp; My lawyer friends think about the law, my academic friends seems to spend their days opining.&nbsp; So I think it only natural that I, someone neck deep in social services, think about poverty.&nbsp; But just as any sociologist would tell you, you can't take the research subject out of the research, not when the focus is social.&nbsp; This idea holds true in the work I do in social services, and I know occurs to many of my colleagues as well.</p>
<p>I don't just think about the poverty status of others, I think about the privileges I have in life and how that contrasts to the people we serve.&nbsp; At times I get external pressure to move out of the social service sector, that a career in social services is a "get poor quick" scheme.&nbsp; So the saying goes that with the privileges I've had in life such as a good upbringing and a fantastic education, that I don't <i>belong</i> in social services.</p>
<p>I had an interesting exchange the other day with a person who shall remain nameless, but is very dear to me.&nbsp; She argued both that poverty is such a complex problem that it is insolvable, and that I am too bright and too well educated to work in social services.&nbsp; I asked her "if I am so well educated, and so bright, then shouldn't I use my talents on the most complex and important social issue we face as people?"<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Making money is very doable.&nbsp; Selling products to people who have everything, specializing in the happiness of people numbed by pampering and entertainment, we're collectively good at that.&nbsp; Providing opportunity to the one in five kids living in poverty, or the 50% of youth who will be on Food Stamps at some point in their childhood, these are things we suck at.</p>
<p>I am exactly where I belong.&nbsp; In going exactly where I belong, I realize I have been to places I probably should never have been.&nbsp; I have been in neighborhoods that people like me don't frequent, befriended people who, due to class standing, should be invisible to me.&nbsp; I work twice as hard as the people who would otherwise be my peers for a fraction of the pay.&nbsp; And I really couldn't care less.</p>
<p>I get the point, if I weren't in social services I could have a nicer place, a nicer TV, and my ex-girlfriend.&nbsp; I assure you, I don't want any of it.&nbsp; I am exactly where I belong.</p>
