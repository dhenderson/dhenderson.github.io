Data is not changing the social sector. However the cottage industry propping up around those interested in the intersection of data and social value is booming. I was optimistic when I first heard of the Do Good Data Conference a few years ago, and later the Stanford Social Innovation Review (SSIR) Data on Purpose series (which merged and held their first joint conference a few weeks ago).

My optimism was stained with reality when I attended my first Do Good Data Conference in 2015, which [I wrote about shortly after attending the conference][dgd-post]. I noted at the time that attendees were better described as data *enthusiasts* than *analysts*. The content was thin, the platitudes were thick.

The conference conveners were taking on an impossible task, a fact that is not lost on me now nor was lost on me then. The sector by and large is *interested* in data, but is not well versed in its potential, let alone the technical know-how to turn data into insight. 

People like myself do not need to sit through a session telling us *why* data science is important. We know it is. That's why we went to school to learn statistics *and* policy *and* programing, the fundamental tools of a social sector data scientist . But not everyone is in the same place or has the same background. How do you put together one conference purporting to be all things to all people interested in data in the social sector?

**Regression to the Mean**

After attending the 2015 conference, I still wanted to believe Do Good Data could meet two masters, both a technical and a non-technical audience. Between attending the 2015 and 2016 event I was also on a panel for an SSIR Data on Purpose conference, which was even higher level and less technical than Do Good Data.

For the 2016 Do Good Data conference I hosted a technical session on building data driven interactive web applications with the statistical computing language [R][r] and a framework called [Shiny][shiny]. I didn't want to just complain about the conference, for the sake of my sector I wanted to do my part to try to help make the conference more valuable for technical folks like myself.

My hypothesis going in to Do Good Data 2016 was that maybe two people would attend my talk. After all, it was a talk about data science tools at a conference that panders to the non-technical. I was spectacularly wrong, and enjoyed giving a talk to a packed room of fellow R users in the social sector.

"Finally, my people!" 

I was thrilled to be wrong. But after my talk several attendees both thanked me for my session and confirmed my fears - they too found the conference generally underwhelming and sessions unsubstantive. My talk was an outlier since I *actually taught* people how to use a technical tool, and provided sample code that we went through together.

At a technical conference code samples and walk-throughs should be the norm. But it wasn't, and it became clear to me that Do Good Data just isn't a technical conference.

**The Conference We Need**

Do Good Data and Data on Purpose are popular conferences, I'm not arguing they should not be. Who am I to tell someone they don't get value out of attending a conference?

All I can do is speak to my own experience, and my own needs. I would *love* to attend a *technical* conference on data science and the social sector. But no such conference exists.

Instead I have accepted that the conferences I get the most value out of are technical conferences targeted at for-profits. There is a world of awesome tools and techniques out there. It pains me to say that for-profits have much better grasp on using these tools. I would rather mix with my fellow do-gooders, but the capitalists are just more mathy.

The downside of course is that every technical conference I attend the examples are invariably geared toward optimizing advertisement placement, enforcing copy-right laws, or some other corporate ambition I either do not share or even repel.

But as a practicing data scientist in the social sector, I need to spend my limited time and cash budget for conferences on building technical skills. Of course it would be much more valuable and enjoyable for me to attend a conference of social sector analysts presenting the work they are doing and providing sample code and technical walk-throughs. But as best I can tell, no such conference exists.

Therefore, when forced to choose between "Do Good" or "Data", I have to choose data. If you are a technical data analyst working in the social sector, I recommend you do the same.
