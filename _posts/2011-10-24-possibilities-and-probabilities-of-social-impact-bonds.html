<p><a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/10/24/possibilities-and-probabilities-of-social-impact-bonds/wall_street__1987/" rel="attachment wp-att-641"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-641" title="wall_street__1987" src="/assets/images/wall_street__1987-250x195.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="195" /></a>Last Friday the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Partnership hosted a <a href="http://philanthropy.com/blogs/government-and-politics/white-house-event-on-nonprofit-finance-to-be-streamed-live/29516">one day seminar</a> on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/factsheet/paying-for-success">pay-for success</a> (also known as social impact bond) approach to social sector financing. I’ve been <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2011/04/04/social-impact-bonds-will-fail-without-solving-the-evaluation-problem-first/">critical of social impact bonds (SIB) in the past</a>, so was interested to watch the White House’s live stream of the event.</p>
<p>The promise of social impact bonds is to provide a new way of financing <em>some</em> social interventions. Panelists at the White House summit were quick to acknowledge that SIBs are not a cure all approach, and that not all interventions are well suited for this type of funding.</p>
<p>My criticism of SIBs in the past has been that the investment approach assumes evaluations can be performed reliably. Obviously, <a href="http://idealistics.org/fcp/2010/11/11/focus-on-scaling-evaluations-is-premature/">I think evaluation is a pretty thorny</a> issue that we have a long ways to go on. I was happy to see that proponents of SIBs at this event were aware of this problem, and while more optimistic about which programs are easily measured than I am, realized there were limitations.</p>
<p>The example that has been most used in peddling SIBs, and the only actual implantation of the concept I’m aware of, involves an anti-recidivism program in a UK prison. Prisons provide a nice opportunity for evaluators because you can easily collect longitudinal data (prisoners and parolees are already monitored) and you have a logical control group (neighboring prisons).</p>
<p>Other social interventions don’t provide such fertile ground for experimentation. Yet ascertaining the effectiveness of a program is at the heart of the agreement between an investor and the government, which backs the bond.</p>
<p>Indeed, as was discussed at the seminar, the critical negotiation in a SIB is when the investor and government establish the ground-rules for when the government pays out, and when it doesn’t. The investor has an incentive for weaker evidence of success while the government prefers stronger.</p>
<p>While the SIB discussion centers on thresholds like the number of positive outcomes, the discussion got me thinking about another metric of success, the <em>probability</em> that an intervention actually caused a desired outcome.</p>
<p>For example, an employment program might place a hundred people in jobs in a month, but would those people have found jobs anyway? This is the question a control group helps inform. But the control group does not answer this question definitively. Instead the best evidence one can get is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>A program exceeds its outcomes threshold</li>
<li>There is a certain probability that the program deserves credit for this success</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the question is not just about achieving an outcome objective, but how sure we are that the relationship between the intervention and outcome is not due to random chance. Achieving a high significance threshold further limits the possibilities of SIBs, as in order to ensure fairness to both the bond holders and backers, ample data in a controlled environment is a necessity.</p>
<p>The White House seminar, as well as discussions I’ve had since my last post on this topic, softened my stance on social impact bonds. As <a href="http://www.socialfinanceus.org/about/staff/tracy-palandjian">Tracy Palandjian</a>, CEO of <a href="http://www.socialfinanceus.org/">Social Finance</a> smartly said, social impact bonds are about managing “execution risk”. Where there are opportunities for well controlled experiments, like prisons, SIBs might very well help governments manage that risk.</p>
<p>What SIBs won’t do is drive innovation, nor will they replace all existing forms of social funding. But they don’t need to in order to be a success. If SIBs can help governments improve the performance and financing of a subset of their social investment portfolios, that’d be a significant accomplishment anyone would have a hard time questioning.</p>
