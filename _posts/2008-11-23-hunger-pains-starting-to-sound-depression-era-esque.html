Farm”.</a> The article explains that a Colorado farmer family opened up their 600 acre farm for people to pick free vegetables. The farmers expected about 10,000 people would come, but instead about 40,000 came seeking free veggies.</p>
<p>I find this to be a telling example of the dire need American families find themselves in due to the economic crisis. The visual image of 40,000 people ascending on a Colorado farm to pick free food for their families sounds less like a recession and more like a sign of the second American Depression.</p>
